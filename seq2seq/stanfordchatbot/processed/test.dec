Forget it.
Cameron.
You're sweet.
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Expensive?
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
You did what?
Why didn't you tell me?
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
I just wanted --
No! I just wanted
Daddy, no!
Thirty-two.
Get out!
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Will Bogey get bent?
Don't make me do it, man
She's partial to Joey, not me
Away.
And why would I do that?
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
Fine, thirty.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
What?
Get her to act like a human
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
We're not.
You and Verona?
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
I know a lot more than that
You -- covered in my vomit.
Why 're you doing this?
Who?
I hate him.
Busy
Why'd you lie?
So what did I have an effect on ?
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
Go to the prom with me
No what?
You tell me.
What?
I didn't care about the money.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Parts of it.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Oh yeah.
Right.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
What's to discuss?
Tumescent!
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
That ' s what I thought
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
I am, Your Eminence
Your life, and that of others!
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
... and also to bring medicine.
Passion is something one cannot control!
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
Damn God!
Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
How long?
New worlds create new people.
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
Twenty eight.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
You think I don't know that?
You bloody...
He must be replaced.
Because he is not afraid of me.
Here.  I have your money.
He has the camera!  He took the movie!
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Yes, but he was a cop.
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
I'll get my clothes.
Go on.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
Okay.  But not water sports.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Stay with her.
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
Pretty.
Hmmmm.
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
I'm serious here.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
Alright?
Alright.
Okay.
I'm not.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Well, that's great.
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Tonight.
Keep them out of my way.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
Please join us.  Come on forward.
In here, says he wants a million.
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
You said speak Czech!
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
Yeah?  What kind?
Oh yeah, why?
You hear that question, Garcia?
Not good.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
That seems very unlikely.
Yes, I thought so.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Two more.
Roger.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Are you coming to my party?
Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
Fine.
Really?
Fortunately, they did.
Well, I'm glad about that.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
True.
That's true
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
I want to pick up my car.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
You got a real big mouth, convict.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
Sure, anything you want.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
I think you better put him on ice, man.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
The bet's off.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Yeah?
How did they get away?
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
First, the money.
Five bills.
This ain't a credit business.
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
Why?  What's wrong with me?
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
We have to save the world.
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
Perfect.
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
Leeloo..
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
You have nine points left on your license..
Uh... not really.
Not without Leeloo.
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Apipoussan?
You know women normally change five times more than men.
OK, you can turn around!
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Exactly.
Talk English Doc.
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
How much time is left?
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
No... not at all.  Where are you?
Your clothing reeks of it.
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
Tom...
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
You don't understand...
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
Nobody knows anything.
I want to watch you work.
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
Any good?
I know what you did.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
I want his name.
It was a lot of fucking money.
Something like that.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
Where?  Show me where.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me "pops."
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
Who is he, his name?
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
Thank you.
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
Yes.
Why do you think he did it?
No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
I don't know.  I think so.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
You could do worse.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
Is there something we can do?
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
Oh God!  He killed them!
Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
Sobering...
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
Well we gotta do something!
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
Yeah...
That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
I want to talk about the baby.
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
All of us.  Right?
How is he - ?
I'd sooner swim!
Yes?
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
Anything ---
Minus three.
Toward the Pole!
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Who?
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
Twombley involved?
Same old shit.
Yeah. I know about that.
This spring.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Yes.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Oh.
Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
If you get it?
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
How'd you get the job?
No, I mean whereabouts.
Where'd you get the blood?
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
Yeah.
Break stuff?
Did you do that when you were a kid?
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
It's not that.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Pop?
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
Fine.
What are you sorry for?
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
You don't want the extra police pay?
Huh?
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
You and Mel Gordon?
Did you get his number?
For a while.
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
I don't know for Christ's sake!
Wade.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
There's a furnace.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
This town sucks.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
You remember Margie Fogg?
In the living room.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
Crawl!
Who?
Huh?
The night before the shooting.
What happened?
Get some sleep.
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
That it wasn't an accident.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
I don't know. You tell me.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
That's what you think.
Alice...
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
Hey, you guys back already?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
Thank you.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
What?
Please... don't start with me.
We're handling it, sir.
This is the President.
Did we tape the Duke game?
Sir...
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
I was reading too.
I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
Commissioner, Aquarius.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Te...!
Ask Simon.
Who's that, Ted?
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
Let me by, Elaine.
Not now, Elaine!
Elaine, we have to go back.
Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
That's my girl.
That's not possible.
Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Yes.
Don't try to stop me!
But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.
I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
He didn't recognize me.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.
Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
Screw me?  That can't be right.
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
Why?
Thank you.
Nothing.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Tell me about it...
Sure.  Just a minute.
The human?
That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
Departmental policy.
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Talk to me, Hudson.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Could it be intelligent?
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
Corporal Hicks!?
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
I don't know.
So?  So?
That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
Don't be long, Ellen.
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Seal the door.
It's readin' right.  Look!
How long have I been on Gateway station?
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
No, it's different, honey.
Did you ever have a baby?
Yes.  A little girl.
Right here, baby.  Right here.
That's right.
It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
What do you mean?
Good morning.
No.
In a harem.
You might be disappointed.
What??
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
I want to go!
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Why? People fart backwards.
No, I'm not playing this game.
Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
You borrowed money from your mother?
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
He's terribly busy, sir.
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
Money! Money!
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
Yes. He is a little strange.
Who was your teacher?
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
It's just a trifle, of course.
Majesty.
No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
And German?
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
Thank you, Sire!
What is it?
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
He's here.
Why not?
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
She does. She says I sleep all day.
Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Yes what?
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
What?
That kind of music should be punishable by death.
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
Really? Why?
How fortunate.
With all my heart, Mozart.
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
What?
Who?
He knows. He knows!
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
We ended in F Major?
Sing it back.
Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
Yes!
Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
Who is on this committee?
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
What do you want?
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
I do not seek forgiveness.
He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
My son, no one can speak for God.
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
But not his body.
Oh my son, my poor son!
Where?
Ballet? What ballet?
Who is she?
Excuse me, my dear.
But he's all right?
I'll call tomorrow.
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
Call me Alex.
Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Yes, go on.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
Will you think about it?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
Do me an enormous favor?
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
No.
Chart says he's from New York.
Has he been refusing food?
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
What time is it?
Bambi?
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
I really don't know.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Nice to see you.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
What?!
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
I will not accept this! Now go away!
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
He's on the telephone.
And what, Sergeant?
Why not?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
We'll discuss that in the board room.
You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
We can take blood from anything —  If it's comin' to us.
Why not?
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
Now?
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
The theatre?
I don't know.
You're protecting somebody.
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
Why pick on him ?
Yes.
Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
Mine too?
Don't you think I know it?
Yes, sir.
I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Oh, is that so?
Yes.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Oh now, don't be silly.
Yes, why?
Then where were you?
Bought himself a pocketbook!
Never a good thing.
Say we bust into a bank. We yell "We're the Younger-James Gang!" People are gonna be thinking, "The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
He just lost his temper a little.
Exactly.
How?
Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
She got two of them.
All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
So what do we do, General Lee?
Sorry.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
I got us through the War all right.
Missed you too, cousin.
Well?
Both would be nice.
Sadie was not a man!
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
They're just insurance in case we run.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
Fine. I'll just wait here.
Died a hero.
Heard of him.
Don't care.
The posters?
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
You didn't want to farm?
What?
You are a hell of a woman.
Damn.
Was it worth it?
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
You do that.
This time we'll make an exception.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
I'm doing you folks a favor --
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
I remember you.
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
No.
On a lot of lithium?
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Uh huh.
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
Are we here?
Is it a what?
What do you want, Courtney?
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Do...what.
Is your Evian spiked?
No-I can't take the time off work.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
What are the rules for a sweater vest?
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
Are you sure?
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
Why not, you stupid bastard?
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
It looks that way, doesn't it?
Maybe it's just the light.
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
New card. What do you think?
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Leaving what?
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Thanks, Patrick.
Who?
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Forget it.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
You're at Paul Owen s.
Does he do this all the time?
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
Where did you go to school?
What?
Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
So...you hang out here a lot?
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Not really.
What?
Let's see...  That you were with-
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
I'm hungry.
Oh well, you know.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
...Whaddo I do?
So you believe me?
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
That'll be a test, won't it?
I don't think he knows how.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
Sure, I'll see what I can do.
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
What're you implying.
Nothing!
The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
Those really weird, short lines.
What're we looking for?
You know my name.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Show me.
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
Before they kill somebody else, too.
What'd he say?
"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
It's three years old, it --
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
I didn't plan this.
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
We won, Austin.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Thank you.
Excuse me?
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
That does not compute.
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Man, you are one chilly square!
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
I'm sure.
How do you know?
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
I couldn't have another bite.
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
Of course, luv.
Not now, Austin.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
Don't worry!
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
Where did you learn to shoot?
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
Scott, don't say that...
Great.
You didn't...
What about his teeth?
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Did you ever...
... bottle ...
Hope...
Fear ...
As you see.
Really -- what happened in 1922?
People, too.
Hmmm ...
He tried to warn us ...
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
So am I.
Thanks, Valentine ...
You're mad.
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
I'll never marry you.
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
And just what is the game?
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
Or half cocked.
Do you really think so?
As per mother's instructions.
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
How on earth can you tell?
Is that written in his shoe?
No trouble.
Always.  Except ...
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I'm playing to win.
As far as you trust me.
You'll find out.
You didn't tell her?
Have we been invited?
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
Have a look at this.
Have you any place in mind?
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
You're saying I have no choice.
Half-brother to be precise.
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
Who's now vanished.
I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
Where?
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
Both, actually.
You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
Walk over to the window ...
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
I'm very happy for you two.
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Are you going to have women at your party?
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
I can't sleep.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
A real turd.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
I want women.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Feel free.
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
No. Let's at least finish the set.
The phone made me do it!
You've been having strange sex...!
This isn't right.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
What's this?
Still drawing a blank.
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Yeah...
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
-- Never mind.
-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
When dad died, I saw another fire...
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
-- What were they doing there?
Shut up!
Thanks for calling.
Really? No kidding.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
I wanted to be a good one.
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
-- Another backdraft.
I don't work for them, either.
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
Did I say thanks?
Yeah.
I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
It's in my blood, Willy.
Firehouse.
You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
It's not your roof anymore.
He's got piano lessons.
He treats you okay?
You treated me like shit.
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...  I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to...  I miss you.
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
He works for me.
Nobody cares, Ronald.
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
I might.
Don't you have any leads at all?
Investigator...
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Yeah.
Then c'mere. I got something for you.
Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Me?
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
I forgive you.
OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it?
I want 15 on the Mets.
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
Did he gots to be.
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
Let's go NIGGERS.
Louder.  They can't hear you.
Yeah, him.
What's your name?
Seconds and thirds, too.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
No costume.  No blackface.
Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon. 
I'm sorry I'm late.
I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
So what's up with you?
He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
Hello.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
How so?
I don't want to hear it.
Hi, Mona.
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
Same thing Giuliani said.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
Soon.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Not her, the one with the little...
...yes she did.
...then what about...
...too late, maybe around...
...like fried and chicken...
I slept too near where I fell out.
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
How be dat?
Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother. 
A song a comin' I feel.
Enough.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
You look beautiful like that.
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
Why don't you answer?
That is none of your business.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
And so I am.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
It must have been some other gate.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud.
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
Yes, sir.
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble.
That is a trifle strong.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
How so?
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
As much as possible.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
The Prince left him only that choice.
Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."
You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
Good night, my little darling.
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Yes, papa.
Yes, he's fine.
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Sir, let those laugh that win.
Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
I'm -- I'm sorry...
Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this.
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
They're dead, aren't they?
Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?
No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
I didn't shoot West --
Of course --
You saved Kendall's life --
Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
Jesus!
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.
There were six of us...
I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!
What happened to "degrees"?
Mr. Hardy?
Stop.
My heart weeps.
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
Yeah.
You and the Colonel go back.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
That bugs you too?
What?
For what?
Good, just making sure.
A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero.
I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
What?
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
Bullshit --
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs!
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
Then do it.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
Son?
What?
How I go.
The River!
You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
He's up with your father.
Really! That's wonderful.
That's okay?
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
There's over eighty thousand here.
It is. I did it cooking.
What are you doing here?
No I haven't.
And...
Right.
Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
Oh nothing.
He wants money.
Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
Right. Okay. Good.
Yes.
Happy bath day.
Syevodnya
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
I do. I want to very badly.
What?
You don't want to talk about it.
And? What are you saying?
Some... What does that mean?
Get out.
She's dead.
What was her name?
What's your name?
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
Well. It's good to see you.
That'd be nice.
You gonna sing me somethin'?
I'll take a jar of that, too.
You gonna miss your bus.
She's around. Always is.
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
Kept us warm for twelve years.
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
Or what? OR WHAT?
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
In my house, you watch that lip...
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
Get a good picture in your mind.
Huh?
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Uh-huh.
Nuh-uh.
Ain't gonna be moved?
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
Not like that.
Please don't tell my daddy.
Yes'sir.
You struck some gold, didn't ya?
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
That's right.
You could put it that way.
I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
Got in a little accident.
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
Stolen phone cards and two-ways is what you sayin'.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
Why?
The Wolf?
They say we got to turn around and come right back.  That's what they say.  I got a plan.
Not a prayer.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
Why the hell not?
I don't, that's all.
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
You were too far behind.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
Nick, you can't do this.
Call for help.
He gets as much as he wants.
He's on duty.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
You met her.
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
I don't remember you saying no.
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
Might be different in New York.
You are a lucky man.  Where you come from a man can stand out.  It's expected.  Here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.
Time, I've got plenty of.
Don't be.
Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it. That's orders.  Period.
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
I'll pay you.
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
If I say no?
You want him dead too.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
What about E.M.S. recombination?
If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
His company made us.
Thank you.
He's not ready yet.
When?
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
Where do we start?
Who.
Sorry, don't have the time.
I gotta piss.
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
These aren't just...
Never been more sure of anything in my life.
Too old.
What did she want?
Who?
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
Are you for real?
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
Come on.
I'd never get an abortion.
In your opinion.
I work alone.
Can you?  I couldn't.
Me and my dad.
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
Like?
I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
How do you know I'm not?
What one?
I was hoping you'd say that.
You scared me.
What's your problem?
What's that?
Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
I'm Adam Webber.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
Young man, stop right there!
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
What?!
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
You're lost?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Dickhead?
Yes, I'm right?
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
You don't?
Get away from me!!
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
Okay.
Everybody's divorced.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Yes!
Sure.
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
I know first aid!
It was at least as good as the sky.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
Yes.
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Like one of Mom's?
Shit is a French word?
I'll try.
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
I don't think so.
Yes. He likes windows.
True.
I'm not wearing his pants.
No.
The hotel.
How old are you?
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Hi.
Really? No kidding?
Oh, you got a problem with that?
You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
I just hope this is still good up there.
Mom?
Well, where are you --
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
Yeah.
Good.
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
Yes.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
No.
What shall we call him?
You bet.
Yes.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
No.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Or have perfect table manners.
Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Is Sandy part of this?
No, not at all.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Nobody.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
No.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
No. I should go.
No police!!!  No police!!
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Yes.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
What?
Don? Where is he?
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
My bourbon.
Yes, but.
Those are my breasts.
Go where?
Do you see, Ben? I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back. 
Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?
Yes.
What?
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Terrible boring.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Let's go.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Brilliant.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Probably not. No. Why?
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Stop it Mike.
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
Yes mother.
Look under the body.
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
What?
You think they sold me out? No way.
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
We paid attention in school.
Our mother can see through bags.
Shut it. It's Ma.
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
Where's my cat?
New hitman wants to leave his mark
The Greeks. The Italians.
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
I...
So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
Y'know it is, a bit.
Well, what'ya do?
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
I mean he ain't here.
Y-Yes my son.
You feel?
You know them personally?
Open it!
He's a nigger.
OK. That's wrong.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
How was I ridiculing you?
I'm lookout.
That sets it off.
That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --
Nothing. Go ahead.
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
Where's the other stocker?
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
I keep it for emergencies.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
What. What's the matter?
On the left.
Where was it parked?
This morning.
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
Don't panic, Anthony.
That's not correct.
I know that. But --
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened.
As a person?
You're all clear.
Dignan, I --
Dignan, I --
Grammar.
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
There's a million places to hide around here.
I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
Sixty days?
Like silk?
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
That's your friend Anthony?
Yeah.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
I don't know about that.
Let's cut the bullshit.
I told you he's crazy.
That's my responsibility.
That's too bad.
This is natural.
Bob, I've got nightmares.
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
This could be a trap.
Yes, I do.
What is it?
What's his name?
Anthony. Bad news.
Not bad.
Bob, you're lying!
Yeah?
Let's go!
I think so.
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
This is no good.
What can we do?
Where's that guy going?
She is a good looking woman.
What?
The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness.
Will it track back to us?
I want to know what happened.
Do you know what his budget was?
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
Don't know.
I'm sorry, Ward.
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
It was staged?
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
What?
Yes...
YOU'RE A LIAR!
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
I'm sorry.
Drop it.
-- it hasn't been two years --
But we were so careful.
He was at the campground yesterday.
Switch! You drive!
-- it's just him? --
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
What is this, a game?
Last week? When?
Bourne?
I want to come in.
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
Careful...
What?
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
What? The tapes?
Me? Four years.
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
Did you?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
And why is that?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Are we locked up?
I don't want to leave.
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
Scotland. He intends --
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
A patriot!
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
Let her speak.
Thank you for inviting.
Did it work?
Tonight then.
I need you so much! I love you!
Wake up, William. Wake up!
...I wouldn't know.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
It does me good to see you.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
You know the answer to that.
Can't he come out for one day?
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
Can you protect me?
Straight up.
Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
So you believe me?
Not in this wing, actually. No.
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
But I... I need those books.
This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
Fuck off, frat boy.
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
Those are your clothes, silly.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
Why's that?
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
Been there, done that.
I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
And you are...?
Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
Yes?
I should have known.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
That's all right.
What do you want for Sam?
I don't buy or sell human beings.
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
Yes, something.
Occupied France?
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
What are they?
No.
Yes?
Looking for a job.
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
But Richard, no, I, I --
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
What of it?
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
Are you quite finished with us?
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
What, again?
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
He'll take one.
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
Excuse me.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
No, I don't.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Feels so good to lie here.
Take it, damn it.
You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
They're on autopilot.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Well, not really, I --
No.  that was the last one.
I had it on the island with me.
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
Not if you work for FedEx.
Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
What was inside?
Yeah?
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
Mom, meet Jango.
I'm doing fine.
You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I don't have it.
Baloney.  I do see the damn "big picture."
That's why you're a gambling man.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
I braided them.
Hallelujah.
Believe me I know.
That's what it's about.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
Why not?
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
I've never seen the ocean, either.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Mr. Rose *knows*?
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
Why?
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
Nobody ever wants me!
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
*Liver* killed him?
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
I haven't read that.
I don't think so.
Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
We see you next harvest.
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
He ain't never been outta Maine!
Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.
No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut.
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
What's a King Pin?
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
I told you, use less powder.
It gets worse. Now I know why he was such a good rope. I mean, cash... That much and we never had to put him on the "Send?" Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant for the King Pin.
Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
Why?
But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
I'm sorry.
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
I got scared.
I despise the job.
Not like Matt, you mean.
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
Not particularly.
You mean I won't resist them.
What job?
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
I start Monday week.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
Are you drunk?
Probably.
It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
Gambling's not about money.
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
Then what?
You're already alone.
How can anyone be that naive?
Found a job?
Yes, I know that.
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
You're serious.
You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Did you solve your problems?
Who did it? Tell me!
You did?
Are you going to put a spell on me?
I might.
Turn left at the lights.
Over the river.
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
"The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." Ernest Hemingway.
Rough life, Jack.
Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight.  Hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
He's a good customer.
Where is it? What did you do with it?
Where is the key?
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Pinback, throw me the chart log.
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Hello, bomb.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?
It is intuitively obvious.
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
I have no proof that it was false data.
Mafhkin oble groop...
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
Yes, Doolittle.
Which one?
Any of 'em any good?
Ah, negative drop.
Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
Well, what you might try is --
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Sir?
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Oh, yeah?
How I make my living, what's your point?
Guess again.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
None of your business.
Can I say something in my defense?
Where?
Justine was not an unwilling participant.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
Same old story.  Not interested.
Every week.
SHHH!  Don't do that!
Hello...
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
How do I know you didn't?
That would be appropriate, yes.
C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
How much do you know?
Hardly...
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
And if I ever catch you coming near my man again...
A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail...
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
Got a pencil?
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
Pull the cash.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
You're the best, Maxie.
Does this person have a name?
I'm a toy to her.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
Easy Sketchy.
Theo's dead.
More than anything in the world.
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.
Whatever... stella.
Plenty, but it was all bad.
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Cool, bro, now listen up...
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
Grounded for the rest of the year?
What?!
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
Yeah.
What happened?
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
You know what? I think that you did it.
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
Where are we going?
Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
You want to kiss me...
The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.
My mom is gone.
Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Grandma Death.
Yes.
Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
No. That makes you keep searching.
What did you find?
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
Regret.
Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
I have the power to build a time machine.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Why would I tell Mom?
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
Her name is Gretchen.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Frank?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
Oh-yah.
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
Okay.
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't...
My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
We was robbed.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Oh, naw. Hi.
This here's Loretta.
Loretta, shut it.
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
Okay. Take her purse.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
And the year before that?
"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
Yeah.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Yeah, yeah, the Jew.
Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!
What!
I will if you shut your piehole.
Harold!
There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
What kind of a dog is he?
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
Then you don't wanna work hard?
What do I get?
Why wasn't I insulted?
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
Sure.
It must be done right away.
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder.
You upstart!
That's it!  No man lives who can call a Firefly an upstart.
Yes.
Bah!! 
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
Your Excellency!
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
Oh, would you...?
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
One or two?
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
What do you mean?
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
Do you?
I found it.
I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!
Yes sir.
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
I don't know what I've got.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
No, but I certainly shall.
Oh no?
Of course! You want out?
Oh, yes.
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
Say "Merrick".
Say "Mmmerrick."
Hello, my name is John Merrick.
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?
Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
Ohhh...
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
There is one more thing, John. Here.
Oh no, I couldn't.
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
Yes sir.  What's that?
Yes. John wants it.
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
Who, Father?
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
WELCOME?
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
And I thought you said it was something special...
Five this week; how many the week before?
I... but I...
It is day, of course, Freya.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
A lot of people like our singing.
But you don't want to hear it.
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning.
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Sh!
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Oh, get it over with.
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
But...
You talking piffle, son?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
It's always the women that start the trouble.
She got me thinking...
Row! Row! Row!
ROW!
Why should WE care?
Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
Who gets killed?
Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
Over the Edge of the World.
Yeah... well...
You will wait?
Please.
Oh...
Can't make enough axe-heads!
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Help!
You went berserk...
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
Easy, Dad!
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
It's okay, really.
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Yes?
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
You're sure? It's cold.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
No, I'm okay for now.
You pick it.
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
That's scary sounding.
I think so.
You'll call me, right?
Yeah.
Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
Yeah, Tangerine?
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
Egad, were you horrified?
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.
Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
I'm Joel.
What do we do?
Um, no.
It's freezing out here.
Tomorrow?
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Well, you obviously don't know me.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
I don't know. Panties and --
Hi.
I just got in.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
And what are you like? A wino?
I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
You take it. I don't know.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
No. I just need some space, maybe.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
Nah, I don't know.
Hi.
Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
We haven't checked.
Go.
You love him, don't you?
Shit!
Happy. Happy with a secret.
Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
Welcome, Howard.
How do you mean?
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
Yeah. Of course.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
Okay, There's more, Stan --
It's a quote book.
Save your breath for the climb.
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
Easy come, easy go.
I'm staying with the Countess.
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Well.... er...
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
What guy?
It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.
I was a successful model once.
For magazines?
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually.
A job for me?
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
I think I found something...
The containment, Second Containment...
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
Can you shut it down?
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
We'll make it.
Hear what?
90 over 50 and falling... .
His peritoneum has ruptured...
I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
Does he know that?
From the Other Place...
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
I'm not the Devil.
We don't have time to fart.
No, no, we just got her back together...
I just finished drying...
Come around to three-three-four...
We can take the filters from the Clark...
Do it. Dr. Weir...
Five seconds.
...repeat, we're armed...
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Can you see a body?
Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock?
I like the sound of that.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
Youthful high spirits.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
'Course not. Strictly business.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What do you mean "complete"?
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
Now.
Please tell me you go silent too.
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
Passion.
The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
And reverse the mutations --
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
You were?
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
Reed, we're running out of time.
Ben did this.
Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Skeptical...?
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
Of course.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
Later.
Why can't you do it?
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Your friends use the pool too.
Don't strain yourself.
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
No.
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
I know it's yours.
We've got to get an abortion?
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
No. It's too soon.
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
Sensitive -- what is that?
So what makes you so sensitive?
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
No way! He just called him a dick.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
You're right. I didn't tell you that.
I want romance.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
I don't know.
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
You're gonna flunk me?!
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
Yes... I am really nineteen.
You keep them.
My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Excellent.
Do you want to come inside?
Aren't your parents asleep?
What about the notes?
I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
Okay. Thanks.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Righto!
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Not down in my parts.
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
You whore!
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
Do they pay you to screw that bear?
What for?
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
I remember thinking, "Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid."
...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
Two glasses of ice water with ice.
Never missed a plane yet.
Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!
Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
I don't know what you're talking about!
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people.
But it's got teeth.
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
Anyone else?
But --
Good.
Huh?
Is it gassed up?
Fully.
Max?
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
Get outta here.
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
MOVE YOUR ASS!
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.
Nothing, just lookin'.
Right.
I think --
I just hit it like you said.
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
'Forgive'...? For What?
I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
Very fine bone structure.
I intend to make a great deal of money off you.
Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
Where's Clifford?
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
An actress.
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
We'll get you home, Frances.
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
Oh, Kurt!
Only if you were in it. Are you?
I wouldn't miss it.
Are you really serious? About acting?
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
Why, you... you little bastard!
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess.
You think I'd miss it?
Well? What'd you think?
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
You're not the quiet type, Frances.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
Came to get a tan.
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... 
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
Calm down, Frances.
Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
I'll bet.
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
Beats me.
No, Harry, I can't -- 
You're coming.
Whattaya think you're in now?
I got your number, Mister Man.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
And no people.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
Who's writing this guy's lines?
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
You're taking me home!
What?
Sure.
You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
Excuse me.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
Huh?
No!
Better that way... for me.
I don't know.
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
Oh God.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
Yes? And?
No. They don't.
I owe you that. Done.
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
Victor, explain yourself.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
Madness?
Who are you?
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
Thanks, Alice.
Un-hunh.
You okay?
Good point.
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
Is it stuck?
Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
God, but I love that sexy talk.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
Don't call him.
I guess...
Best over...
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
What about Kate?
Jacob.
What's this about, money?
Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
She's dead?
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
You won't let him touch her?
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
I don't have the slightest idea.
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
To yours.
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
It's a flop house.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
No!
You asked me if I would --
Daddy's dead.
Not many.
-- you got your shower --
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
I wasn't scratching!
You believe me don't cha?
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
All I'm saying --
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
You meant that, but you meant the other, too.
This ain't the time.
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples?
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
Yeah, it's mine.
Just some of the women.
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
Of course, but there's more --
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
Really, I have no problem with --
None at this time, sir.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
No, sir, WHAT?
You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
West?
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
No, ma'am.
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
Come on, Montgomery...
Get it up!
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
I take it you don't either.  Feet.
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
Well, now I feel so much better.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
Last time I didn't.
Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
I don't know...
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
We are so fucked.
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
I don't know.  Seems...
Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in this town. You gotta be a killer to get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes.
Me!? You where the one...
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
Sure. I'd like that.
I got pretty close.
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
I was wrong.
Our network covers the Ranger games.
You'd be surprised.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.
We? I don't think so.
Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this?
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent?
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
What are you suggesting?
It's the French Secret Service.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Yes sir... The use of your waste facilities were strangely absent from the historical records, so we had to extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
Leadership....
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
You go first! There's no time!
Yes. Good was done this .....
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.
You could order something in.
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
Down there.
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
Brandon.
Okay, that's where you want to be.
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
Lt. Madison, GO.
There is no weather in space.
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
It's suicide.
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
It's... I don't know.
All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
Where'd they go? Back inside?
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
Tell them? About...
Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Wait... Jason, Here!...
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
I don't know.
Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
We pretend...
Simpler.
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
But there it is!...
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
Anything.
How about the pig-lizard?
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
Is that a fact.
I hope I never have to believe that.
Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!
Well, truth be told?  I was a pharmacist.  Alexander?
I?  You all know my history.
Exactly.  We'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard.  It would cause the line to buckle. Then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half.
There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
Yes, my lord.
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
We've got powder but no ball!
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
Hancock led the Boston 'tea party' because he's a goddamned tea smuggler!  He wasn't protesting inequality, he was eliminating competition.  Now, you listen to me:  we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief, or the south will not fight!  What have we been struggling for all these years?  For this moment!  And, if we fail now, remember:  you stopped us!
Gag on your own invention, then.
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
Unofficially, General Greene.
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
They help me understand why we fight.
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
General Lee, sir!
Surely you knew this was coming.
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
Everything.  If we force Britain into concessions it will open up the western lands -- and that would be a boon for our family.  We already have more slaves than we need, but we need more land.
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
Hear that, George?  Sally's actually taken to thinking of this clod of earth as her home.  And it's her first tour.  We're gratified, aren't we George?
It's stupid, of course.
Well, I hear 'The People'.  Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves.  The world's castaways.  And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming, you will betray them.
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
Farrah. Come here.
What about him?
No. What's this?
Calm down? We're going away for life and you tell me to calm down?
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
You can talk to me.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
In just a second. Two...
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
You serious?
Leo, I don't know.
By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.
The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
That's correct. Look at me.
I'm in the movie business.
Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
Come on, Harry -– Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...
I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
I said I had an idea, that's all.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
Hey, Harry.
Yeah, Chili. Hi.  You're fifty feet in the air!
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
He died.
How'd you know he died, he tell you?
Personally?
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
Ask your man here.
We talk different?
I believe it.
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
What's that?
Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?
What if it was?
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
Then you've read it?
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
I don't know.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
I'm thinking about producing.
She's scared! Fear is an emotion!  Look, kid, if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking.
Hm?
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
Mob guy?
Roger, North Island. Arctic Warrior over and out.
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
Why not.
Yeah.
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
Goddamit, Dodge.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
Why not? Why the fuck not?
If they knew what they were carrying.
How do you mean?
Sorry.
Headache, nausea, lights?
She was sailing up north, right?
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
Only way to be.
Did you see him?
There's somebody else on this boat.
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
Couldn't sleep.
Showing you what?
I don't know.
Epps, over.
Either of you seen Dodge?
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
Over the gold.
Maybe it was more than that.
What?
Go.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
Moving to Sweden.
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
Maybe.
Lost my sea legs.
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
A what?
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Yup.
What is it now?
I guess.
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Well, I know this is really short notice, but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art & Design and she tells me that I'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well, I hope you don't mind, Enid, but I took the liberty of submitting your name.
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
I guess.
What? Why?
Forget it...
I know, she needs to die immediately.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Okay, okay!
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
There's my dad with Joanie.
Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
JOSH!
You won't believe it! Guess!
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
He gives me a total boner!
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
What happened to Seymour?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
What are you talking about? Who?
Just some people from work...
What? When did you see Josh?!
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky."
Seymour does.
Where did you get those pants?
...are you waiting for a bus?
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Five hundred.
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
Indian records?
Okay.
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
Jesus!
I'm not holding my breath in that department.
Jesus...
It's not hopeless...
Hooray for me.
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Hey, can I borrow this?
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Who knows?
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
Just someone so young...
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
I... I don't think so.
So, do you like me, Seymour?
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
What do you want?
What do you want?
I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
Right.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
Talk to us about it...
Right, exactly!
What do you mean?
What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-
You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
I think it's been a pleasure.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
And it worked?
In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
Have you got that in writing? 
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
Possibly.
I'm always considerate- my mother taught me that.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
But of course yours worked.
I got big. 
Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this-  -they're doing it for pleasure.
Good news?
Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
And where will you sleep beautifully?
Help finish the railroad.
Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
Occasionally
Does he ever mention me?
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
Now you're talking.
Ghostbusters.
I don't think we should leave her alone.
Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.
Get on with it, counselor!
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
I hate Jello.
Huh?  What?
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
Hi, Louis.
... I thought it was the drug store.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
He is the Destructor.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
I want you inside me.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
Talk to my accountant. 
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
I think it's the food of the future.
In the physical sense.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Thank you.
Here are tonight's calls.
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
Two wavy lines?
Sorry.  This isn't your day.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
What on earth gave you that idea?
Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
Yeah, I can smell it.
Why not?
It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.
Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
We have to stop the Germans now!
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
Until your confirmation date.
I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
Why do you play at being drunk?
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
Yours will do!
For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men?  How like my father you are.  You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive.
So I understand.
I was summoned.
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
Is anything wrong?
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Did they ever find out?
Yes.
Yes.
What?
Come in.
Let me go.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
We just can.
I'll think about it.
I just don't think it would...
I certainly hope you --
Mr. McQuire.
What are you then?
It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
I am going to call the police now.
I'd rather not.
Will you sign the register, please?
Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
But it's light in there now.
When is he coming back?
I don't know.
Yes.
What do you think?
It's all right.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
Her portrait?
Come on.
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
I've got to go.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Do you want to get it now?
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Yes -- I think that would be good.
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
Is this -- what?
That you're afraid --
INADEQUATE!
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Anything. Anything at all.
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
Him?
Not exactly.
But you don't hate him.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Not particularly.
Why are you asking me all this?
There's nothing to tell.
Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
Good.
No.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
I see.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
Promise me, Benjamin.
I just don't believe you would do that.
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
I'll find her.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
You don't?
Goodnight.
Have you thought about graduate school?
You got me.
Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Swell. I appreciate it.
I've got to go.
I know.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
Yes.
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.
Benjamin -- where are you?
I'd like to discuss this.
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
With the pearls?
If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back --
Oh -- work!!
Reducing?
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Aren't you?
Of course.
Really?
All right. We'll dance.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
And then --?
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
No?
What is the matter?
So --
And now?
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
No?
On the train?
Not at all, sir. 
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
If we could scare up some men to play.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Yes -- but the audience.
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
Good heavens. What for?
No, Doctor.
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?
Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
Preysing?
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Oh yes, of course.
Moreover...
No -- only occasional jobs. 
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
With the same friend?
Not too quickly.
You're a little too fast.
Can't you understand me?
...weight into the balance...
Definitely off.
I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
A thousand marks -- 
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Shhh -- here he is now.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Then, it's all over?
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. 
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Such nonsense.
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
What is this insolence?
Yes, I know them --
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
I know -- I know.
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
You wanna talk to me straight up?
My son --
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
Hah.
Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has--  -- you don't mind my telling him, darling --  -- suffered reverses. If he could...
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
Perk, remember?
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
Fair enough.
Nice to see you.  What am I doing in here?
Sure.
Bluebell came in?
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
Just a few bucks.
And Myra's stuff?
I know you do, so that's why --
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
I can't. I just left home.
Taking you for granite?
Mm?
No more than this?
You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
You already went back to work.
Nobody does that single-o.
I thought these people were broke.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
Where?
I saw her.
She didn't see you, in other words.
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
That's what I say.
) What?
Yes?
What?
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
Happy to see you looking so good.
Girl scouts.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Pretty messy.  Parents have already been notified.  Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
You're kidding with that answer, right?
I borrowed it.
I guess.  It's just hard to believe.
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
What?
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
He's in the bathroom.
You can't expect us to stay here --
Kids are what's ruining this country. Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn respect.
A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
But surely Rogers isn't --
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
Why did you take Jamie?
And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.
Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
Hm?
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
The hell with the diamonds!
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
I'm lonesome already.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
You told me.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Sorry.
Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
You keep on saying "deep" and "deeply." I wish something good would happen on the surface sometime.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
Gee whiz--
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
I wouldn't drop my gun.
Life has denied me that thrill.
No.
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
Mhravitch.
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
Sir?
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Can't it keep till morning?
Penelope!
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
It's your house, Dad.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
We all are.
Have some.
We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
Go on.
It seems highly intelligent to me.
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
Like what?
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
Load it for her.
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Will you please go?  An emergency!
And her fiancé!
I've got to run!
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
Good night.
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
Hundreds.
What for?
You haven't heard me yet.
I've struck my blow.
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
No!
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
There was so much going on.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
Won't you please join our club? Please?
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
Never mind.  It's a dumb theory.  I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol.  Peace.
I don't care what she wears.
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
What a relief!
That's an interesting piece of news.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
Then who flushed the toilet?
For Heaven's sakes!
What does he say to do?
No!
I'm glad.
You don't wrestle if you don't have supreme confidence, and I wrestled. But when I get with you, and I say to myself, "My God--here I am with the wife of Harold Ryan, one of the great heroes of all time--"
We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
What was it?
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
They didn't murder me.
It's a jungle out there.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
Or get eaten alive.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
Phooey.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
What we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room. It's twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars an hour. Anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tips are allowed. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
No, I don't.
You want a tip?
What do you mean?
Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
Yeah. How did you know?
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
You're not a film producer, are you?
How much do you make a week, Niki?
Up front?
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Of Joanne's?
Jesus.
Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple days.
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
Is Kristen safe?
Fuck.
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
What happened?
So then, Mr. Mast...
...What do you have to offer?
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
Who's paying you?
You are.
I'll be there.
I hate it. But you gotta know, buddy.  A lot of strange things happen in this world. Things you don't know about in Grand Rapids. Things you don't want to know about. Doors that should never be opened. I've known more about this sort of thing than a man should. Don't ask me why.
Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen.
Anne wants to make sure you come over for dinner Sunday. With Kristen gone you'll be all alone.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
You're talking about real excitement?
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Let's go.
I don't know nothing, man.
Not exactly...
Jake.
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
He asked me. You going with anybody?
You ever play Chicken?
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
Could I see your registration?
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Where are the papers?
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Lady! Be quiet.
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
Eh, no.
Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?
No.  I thought not.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Well then.
Me! No. Of course not.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
That's a nice teapot.
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
Exactly.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
It's so blue.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
What is it, Harold?
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
Well, don't go.
You should have been a poet.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
I thought eighty was a good round number.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
Oh, he's in the Army. I do so like the military, don't you? Those uniforms make men look so virile. I did "What Price Glory?" in summer stock. I played Charmaine - with a French accent.
I wouldn't say "benefit."
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
What about the draft?
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
Your classmates?
Then why did you leave?
Why?
Thank you, Uncle.
Oh sure.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
Finish what?
Then why are you here?
You were ALL human!
Yeah.
We don't take hints.
No. It's not.
C'mon -- Rasputin??
I thought you liked being on TV.
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
Got tired of me?
Manning says I'm too soft on you --  The candy. Give him the candy.
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
Don't move. We --
No. Don't --
I'm in charge. We go back!
My job.
Goodbye.
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
Red, I --
What -- ?
Yes, I --
My fucking hand!
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
No. That wasn't the deal.
You took quite a beating. You must lie down.
Oh Christ.
Kirsty?
You want it?
That's right. Who are you?
I came for the wedding.
Forget him.
Sure you are.
Tell me, damn you.
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
I don't.
There's very little I can do about it.
Hi. I got soaked.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
So what's the argument?
We'll move in Sunday.
You're done worse.
I'm here.
I'll be down in a minute
O.K.
I've seen worse.
Please...
Plain soda?
No personal details?
We don't need a bed, do we?
I got through.
Where are you?
I said: I found a room.
No Dad.
I love you, honey.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
He's gone.
Gone?
What's the problem?
Just upstairs.
Meaning what?
Your father told me you were working here.
No, it's good to see you.
Can I lend you a hand?
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
It's a fetish of mine.
What happened to you?
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
Play it.
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
What?
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
Right.  Why?
Is that it?
Nice friend.
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
Fine.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
I dunno.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
-- Alright, alright but --
Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
You really believe that?
What were the others?
You won't like it.
I haven't felt like it.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
Great... That's great.
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
Sure they are.
Pig died.
Mmnn.
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
Mission accomplished.
Want to know what, exactly?
You know the difference.
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
You're tougher.
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
I know.  I don't get it.
I mean it.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
Would you marry me if I was?
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Well, you've asked.
Hey.  It's Liz.
-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
Enough of what?
Good.
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Oh, right.  Alright.
Everything all right?
How's the store?
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
And after that?
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
Sure.  Ten cents.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
Fuck off.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
Thanks.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
Tradition.
What the hell is going on?
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
You've been listening to rumors.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
Yes.
At least.
That would be difficult to explain.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
You kill with your left hand?
Damn you.
What do you want from me?
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
What were you doing in Felton?
Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
How can you know this?
Yes.  Always.
Does it change with me in the room?
Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm.
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
I do not think I like the sound of that.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
Who?
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
Like you.
Tradition.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
We have no understanding.
Any other I.D.s come up?
He knows I'm here.  How?
None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...
Offered the Pope one of his whores.
You're insane.
I do hope she enjoys a good show.
MACLEOD!
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
Are you here?
American.
You're wrong.
For the moment.
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
Hello, Bensinger.
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.
The five hundred? Sure.
Yes, wasn't it?
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
The Criminal Courts Building.
Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.
Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
Yes!
Oh.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Where are we going?
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
How?
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
Gee! Take a look, will you?
You'll ask me to what?
Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
Get out of here, you!
I notice you still remember it.
What home?
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
Look at this! 
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
You're not afraid, are you?
No kidding?
How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
I know, but --
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
All the words you've got.
Where's some paper?
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Railroad tickets.
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Come here. See if we can move it.
Who did you talk to?
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Thanks.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
Take that mush out of your mouth!
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
Yeah. But I --
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
Well! Looks like about ten years apiece for you birds!
Now, Hildy --
My name is Louis Peluso.
Who is it?
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
Where's the money?
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far.
I know.
Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.
I concede I was insistent, but how the Devil...
Bloody.
Would.
...and six...
They've got the real thing outside.
Who pays for them?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
Please yourself.
What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
Oh, that.
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
What are you going to be then?
Half the time he's bluffing.
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
No, I won't.
I wish it could all have been different.
And now we're glad you did.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Really, that's a long time.
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
Baby! Stop!
OK.
Come on.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
That's not something to joke about.
You shouldn't a done that.
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
But if you did.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Oh yeah, I remember now.
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
Cat fight, cat fight.
No... yeah, they ripped him to pieces while his family watched from the car. The wife is screaming, the kids are crying. Some dude in another car filmed the whole thing.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
No problem.
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
Here he comes.
Yeah, showtime for what?
Man, it's already ten thirty.
Quiet.
It won't work.
Enough talk, write.
Yeah, he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden in the basement. He keeps 'em taped inside his school workbook.
That kid is one horny retard.
No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
When you were outside with Bill.
This isn't funny, it's twisted.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Sleeping.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
I don't know... about half an hour.
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
Yes, sir.
Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day.
Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.
Shhhh... you hear that?
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
Excuse me for a second.
And?
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
That would be good.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered you.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
I've moved on.
Hunh.
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
With pleasure.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
What's the larger experiment?
I'm not sure.
You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
I like you, too, Nathan.
I'm sorry about my parents.
Why certainly!
I don't think so.  Why?
Absolutely.
He looks perfectly fine.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
Sure. Of course.
Ummm. It's good.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
No, why?
And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
Packard. Sarah Packard.
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
For whom and for what?
That's the way it's done.
Cash.
Twelve thousand.
Deal.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
You hustlin' me?
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert? Course, maybe that doesn't stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else. But it sticks in mine. I loved her, Bert. I traded her in on a pool game. But that wouldn't mean anything to you. Because who did you ever care about? Just win, win, you said, win, that's the important thing. You don't know what winnin' is, Bert. You're a loser. 'Cause you're dead inside, and you can't live unless you make everything else dead around ya.
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Yeah, that's right.
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
Why?
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Whaddya mean?
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
Well, now... I mean, you figure I'm a little drunk, and I'm loaded on the hip, and you just want in, real friendly, while the money's still floating, huh? Okay... Go ahead. Set 'em up.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
Get with what?
You can't see it, can you, Charlie? I mean, you've never been able to see it. I came after him. And I'm gonna get him. I'm goin' with him all the way. The pool game is not over until Minnesota Fats says it's over. Is it over, Fats?
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
A son.
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
I told you you'd get your money back.
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
Yeah. Just like that.
Glad to meet you.
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
Okay?
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Yeah, I'm quittin'.
Yeah? What do you do now?
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
Is that what makes a winner?
Does it bother you? What he said?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
That's what the game's all about.
You watch me.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
You know what I mean.
What's inside?
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Yes.
It was at Diane's party in Malibu and I had just broken up with Todd and I was loaded for bear, any man who had the nerve to come at me -- watch out.  So you come sauntering in -- you know that saunter you do. That watch out, baby, here comes Mr. Smooth thing.
I surrender --
You got that right.
Do we have to?
You'll meet new friends.  I know ... it's rough.  But I have to move, son.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
Let's check it out, Dad.
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
Sure ... fine.
I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
Yes -- but ...
It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
A UFO lands in back of your house and puts something in your Dad and Mom's necks.  Then it gets the police, and your teacher too.
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
This shows how to get to my home. I'm giving you back roads and footpaths, so there's less chance of you being seen.
Who are you calling?
The State Police.
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?
Think nothing of it, Spanky.
More than likely.
What're you talking about?
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
He wasn't the President then.
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
I can't shake her free.
She should be shortly.
It's doing what?
It's... slowing down, Sir.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
Dick-weed.
Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine.
You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me.
All your life.
Yes. My treat.
It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
Where?
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
Yes. Now we know.
It's war.
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
Yes?
I knew it was you --
I usually don't.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Pretty sure.
What?
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
So it did.
I can reach it. I can reach it...
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
Right.
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
Will you take it easy!
She talks in her sleep.
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
Are you kidding? -- I made that up! You know Marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum!
What???
Oh.
...the solution presents itself.
What?
What about Marcus?
Marcus would agree with me.
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
And do I detect a rebuke?
Dad, how can you?
What does that mean?
More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
Thanks.
I know, Dad!
But, Indy --
My name is Kazim.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
Yes, very fine. But not all of the pieces look old. Some were carved recently and look like images used by the Thuggees to worship the goddess Kali.
I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones...
Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
Okay, Shorty.
That's it. Pankot Palace.
Just a statue.
Read you loud and clear, Indy!
You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
No, Wu Han's an old friend I brought along.  So, the game's not over. Put the antidote on the table, Lao.
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Oh yeah?
He told me they knew I was coming here.
Pet it on the head! Go on, pet it!
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
Don't catch cold.
Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
There's got to be another way out.
Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
Willie, come on!
You're not gonna believe this...
I'm...inside you.
Why not.
Who?
Yes.
I see...
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
You said it.
Kill myself.
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
Why? AL  You know too much.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
You are CRAZY!
What does it say.
Where are we going?
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
That's not a good idea.
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
Nothing!
The beach.
I don't want to eat it.
Follow it.
She doesn't seem to understand.
How should I know?
What can I do? You're on your own.
.
Who, me?
That's a big if.
Just hold them close and stay still.
Voice stress analyzer.
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
I don't know!
You found her.
And Dieter?
He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
Aim what?
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
Rene?
Oh no!
That's nice.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
Aren't we all.
Oh, I can't.
Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
It's a long story.
Sir?
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
Enough ROmance.
What things?
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Fine. You look fine.
I feel fine.
You'll feel better
Look, we'll bring your car home. just take it easy until the effects wear off. You need anything, just call this number.
Take the card.
Whatever it is, don't do it.
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
The poet...something he said...
Do what?
Let you leave without it.
You are.
If I was with you, I wouldn't
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
...Naw. Made that up.
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Why'd you run off?
Wanted to get to know you.
What did you tell them?
There's not much to tell.
Who did?
He must be a good friend.
Oh sure.
It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here.
What'd...you forget?
They asked about you.
That I really don't know.
Her?
We just don't stop.
But you did it. It was you.
The experiment. The danger...
It'l be alright.
Whoever took it does.
What about Al...
Hi, Daddy.
Instant rice...?
I heard them.
In the backyard.
You got a deal. 
I'll be there.
What? Forget it.
Get me Wigand.
The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic." It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower."
You're taking "no" for an answer?
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
No, I'm not...
How grave?
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
Is this "Alice in Wonderland"?
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Okay.  Lowell?
You ready...?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
What do you need at the store?
That's my stuff from the office...
That's for food.
Yes... Jeffrey.
Yes.
I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
I have to take a shower.
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
I got perspective.
Okay. Thank you.
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred to this... Said they should be afraid of him... I assume, afraid of what he could reveal.  Now, you tell me. What does this guy have to say that threatens these people?
No shit.
Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired. And others will deal...
Lowell!
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
Everything interests me.
How much would I get paid?
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
Tempura...
Next to your father?
You charge by the hour?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
Yeah, great.
What?
What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
Where you staying now?
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
You're gonna get your fix...
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
"There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."
How does one... "go... to... jail?" What does my family do? Go on welfare? If my wife has to work? Who's going to look after the kids? Put food on the table? My children need me. If I'm not teaching... there's no medical... no medical... even on co- pay, that's like... Tuition...
Seven...
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
You did good, Massey!
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.
Who do you want me to kill?
Grounds?
We rest, Your Honor.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
It was a gift from a client.
What?
He's the wrong man.
Asian? No.
Well... I'm still...
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
What?
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
Ruth Rabino.
Oh boy. If he only knew.
Why would you be here?
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
Well, don't look at mine!
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
She didn't love you?
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
No.
I want... I want to...
Do you want me to sleep on it?
Fabric and fringe.
Hello Marylin.
I love you. I want to have your baby.
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
Hello Miles.
It's not something I wanted either.
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
You have some?
I wish I had your discipline.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Thank you.
Sorry.
No. You're not.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Who's "Patty."
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
Come in. Sit down.
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
We'll go into that some other time.
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
Well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
Oh, come now—
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
What would you like to have me do?
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that—
"What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling."  Send him a telegram right away. Just say: "Let 'em topple."
What happened to your money?
I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
Why, you ungrateful brat!
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
You have your nerve!  Here, boy—!
That's none of your business.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Here—take mine.
Hey—you're little, aren't you?
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Um. You're doing all right.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I—I did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you—
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
You always want to run everything.
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
Aren't you afraid of me?
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
Oh, Peter— 
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
Here. Eat your head off.
Try me.
Uh-huh. Want one?
Nope.
Why not?
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
Won't I ever see you again?
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
Eight o'clock.
When you get through with that, I'll have a beard down to my ankles. 
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
Get out!
What's the thousand bucks for?
Well, I'll be—
Listen, Pal—you've got to get this money for me. Now. Minutes count. She's waiting for me in an auto camp outside of Philadelphia. I've got to get right back. You see, she doesn't know I'm gone.  A guy can't propose to a girl without a cent in the world, can he?
Thanks, Joe.
I don't trust him.
Oh, excuse me.  I was just tryin'—you know—to make things pleasant.
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see—and—
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
If you don't—Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
And Oswald?
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association - they're not...
You know you keep saying that.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
Go on, Willie.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
No, I did not.
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
I see.  And where did you drive?
I believe the boys got a couple.
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Who was paying you, Dave?
Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
There were admirals.
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
How many shots you say you heard?
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a contract agent with the Central Intelligence Agency?
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
I don't think so, Jim...
Huh?
Well... yeah.
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster, Eladio del Valle, in Miami.  I gotta get him in, boss.  I need more men - I can't even pull the teams to watch Ferrie... This is our case!
One shooter.  One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams.  I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people.  Hunters...  patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... "3-2-1...  green!"  Or else "Abort!  Abort!"
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
It never did. 
Was he there often?
Nonsense.  You should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact, affect the world.  Here you're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest.
How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
Uh huh.
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
Who was there for your ass?
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
How old is that machine gun shit?
That's why they call it "fuckin' with ya." Now you wanna hear how we retaliate?
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
What's she willing to give us?
Beauty products.
Fine.
What's her name?
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
'76?
It's nice.
How'd you find that out?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
They seem to like the idea.
Bring the money in and they follow it?
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
Why?
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
What do you do when he comes home?
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
Which one?
All he needed was a reasonable explanation.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
What do you tell Nicolet?
We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
I thought you were tired of your business?
Are you scared of me?
What if I plead guilty?
Yeah?
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
I imagine shit needs to be done.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
You didn't count it?
Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
Si.
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
I'm waiting for the phone.
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
Dreaming.
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Got some o.j.?
You positive about that? You weren't nervous and let something slip by mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I just gotta know.
I knew it.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
I told them.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
That's a good idea.
If you want.
But you don't?
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
Four days ago.
How long?
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
No.
C'mon, don't lie.
You live with him.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
You sure?
Whatcha watchin'?
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
Then put your goddam drawers on, and get your ass out here. I got somethin' to show you.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
Did you get it?
I shot her.
You know how she is.
Where did you shoot her?
We went to the parking lot.
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
Cops can't locate him, huh?
I need your name and address.
House.
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
Before we start talking about stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of the way first.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Is that what I think it is?
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
Call her, tell her the combination.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
I know where it is.
Uh-huh.
You sure?
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
No problem.
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
Then what are you doing here?
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
No! Oh God.
What do you want?
Well, how do I look?
What do you want from me?
Oh, terrific.
It's hard to explain.
Well, try, huh.
Maybe there's a larger truth.
Maybe the demons are real.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
A couple of weeks, I think.
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
I say you should get a shrink.
What can I tell you?
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
I had this weird flash just then.
Louis, you're a life saver.
You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
But I see them.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
Save me!
Don't ask.
Your kid dropped it off.
No. The little one.
Not to me.
Well, you didn't marry her.
I don't like things that make you cry.
How's it going?
What's wrong?
They weren't human!
Get your clothes off!
How come? The army?
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
Where have they gone?
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Where have they gone?
Shows how much you knew.
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
It's strong stuff.
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
Total delirium.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Total delirium.
Last night! They were as real as you are!
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
You've seen them?
Died?
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
No.
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
Suit up.
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Give me a break! What happened?
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
We have to get off this ship.
Were you close to your father?
And what happend to ...?
I'm stuck!
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
GO, GO, GO!
Would you?
You prefer an apple?
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
I missed you too.
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
Ssh.
What?!!
But...I...400 years?
Are we locked down?
What have I done?! Idiots.
Exactly.
Just a favor for your old man.
Here --  Take him home.
Try some of this. I made it myself.
It's my charter. My party.
You got it.
Who's driving the boat?
Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
Get behind me, dummy!  Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line!  Wet my reel, quick!
Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call.
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
He's taken him!
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
Can you do that?
No. Home here.
So we should set out a smorgasbord?
I was only reacting to what I was told.
Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
What? What?!
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
Why don't we just tow it in?
Be careful, for chrissake.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
This is quite a place.
It's a whale out there.
You picked her up on the ferry.
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
You from around here?
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
You love sharks?
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
Thanks for the message.
I'm supposed to be running.
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
No...
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
What a trip, man.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
What is your job title, exactly?
Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
Yeah.
Commercials.
You know... it's parts...
I know what junk is.
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
Yeah, I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there.
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
Consider it your musical education.
Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!
What's the matter?
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
You mean like couples?
Dad, no!
Thundercats are go!
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
Right, seriously.
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
They're yellow.
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
I suppose anything's possible.
...Thank you.
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
...Yeah, sure.
He whips you?
You can?
Early, you are so sweet.
Almost.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
Walter Livesy.
...Too bad.
Now why is that?
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
You wanna hear mine?
Damn right I do.
The party?
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
A book on the warehouse murders?
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
How do you know that?
Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
Shut up Carrie, please... just shut up!
Nervous?
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
She wasn't feeling so good.
Shut your mouth.
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
You fucked it?
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
You think he's got any herb?
78th.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
Why I do what?
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
Yeah.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
You sure?
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.
Do you care about me?
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
One.
Everything is wrong.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.
Mine are like my neck and my chest.
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
Good luck.
I only did it once and...
Yeah?
Whah you say? Dissdee?
It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
He still does.
Yeah?
No.
No. I was just kidding.
What?!
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
What kind of problem?
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we?  He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it.
It's all a big game isn't it?  A sick, fuckin' game.  I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out.  Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place.  It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish.
What's the first street?
Local?
What was your relationship with her?
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
Why not?
If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
--you're hopeless!  You can't even read a sentence!  Didn't they teach you punctuation in school?  The game ends tonight!
Let me speak to my daughter.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
Of course not.
New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
He already did once.
Uh huh.
I'm Kathy.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
What about prints?
That's great.
How long she been dead?
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.
What did Dr. Fulton tell you?
It's important.
Meaning?
Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
You don't have a shred of evidence!
You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
Only in passing.  To say hello to.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
Could Emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill?
Maybe I already have.
Answer the question.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
When I was very young.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
This isn't a game.
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
How can you look at it so clinically?
Let's change the subject.
Alright.  What about me?
It was.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
The line was busy.  I'll try again.
Nothing.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
But I do.
Why?
Are you going to come tonight?
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
That's worse.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
I can't wait either.
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
I don't know how.
The new Queen lives.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
There is no other way.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
I will find her!
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
Yes.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
The Beast will kill her.
You're coming with us.
I can. Because I choose it.
We must enter the swamp.
Even by you?
I cannot betray my bride.
What business?
He saved our lives.
<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
I'm all right.
Not sleepy, either?
At the gallop!
I am Quell.
No.
Would you desert your friends?
Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
No. He will master the leader.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
Yes.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Her name is Death.
She had another name once.
She was not as beautiful.
No, she was not as beautiful.
We had no children.
Yes.
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
...Good...  But what's special in him?
Yes.
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
Yes.
Too heavy.
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
I think.
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
...No... he's my lover...
Huh? Why?
Salute.
May we have this wolf's name and address?
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
How serious is it?
I won't let you die.
The flowers... they're beautiful.
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
Yes.
You can't change your mind.
Yes.
No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
Red flag, man.
If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
Not our problem.
Yeah!
Damn baby, relax.  I'm getting to it.  From Philadelphia following the route highlighted to Pacifica California -- you're traveling an estimated three thousand two hundred miles...
Umm, no.  It's just that --
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
Walking where?
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
Do you have a car, Steph?
Oh, that's not mine.
I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.
Water.
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
Right... OK...
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
Thank you, Sera.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
Yes.
How much, do you think?
I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
Yuri... are you...
Sera... please go.
I have a 4.0.
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
I'll take that as a no.
You're fired. I have new representation.
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
I believe you! Don't worry.
No.
Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
I'm a man who knows what I want.
No, she was crying her eyes out.
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
Uh -- both?
That's terrible!
She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Really?
Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case.
What?!
Josh proposed!
Neat.
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
Aside from that.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
No, she can't move for an hour.
What're you talking about? You earned it --
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
What do you think?
What happened?
What, like on va-kay?
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
And I fully support that.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
Harvard. Law school.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
Wait -- Cecil has a condo in Tahoe. Let's go there!
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
What do you want from me?
My dear Princess, the human soul is a highly elusive commodity.  I suggest you spend some hours before the glass.  Contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul.
And, now?
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
We be honored, friend Ogg.
Faerie ring?
Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
Going grows slower... we've not made... half a mile in two hours...
I know the rogue, Jack.  Tis Jimmy Squarefoot.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
Never mind.  Just do it!  Retrieve the arrows somehow.
That's it!
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
Nay.  Jack's the dragon-slayer, ain't you, Jack.
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
But you did... you did!
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
They rival the angels of paradise.
Are you honest?
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
Do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood?
My lady mocks me.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Everywhere!  Ow!
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
What became of the princess?
No fear of that now.
Wondrously so.
You... you... you mortal you!
I think she's about to foal.
No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
A castle's but stone and mortar --
We did a lot of the wiring too.
Mom said I should.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
I've taken a lot of morphine.  Oral morphine...for my back.  Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing?
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
I can't even take a shower here.
No.  That's okay.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
Really?
He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it.
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
Josh said...
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
You'd hate him for the trick.
He's got a standing invitation.
It could have been a squirt gun.
A sink?
I flushed it down the toilet.
Pardon me?
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
Well, I feel better about this now.
Well, it's the least I can do.
We're getting out of the ground today.
You have everything?
Don't touch me!  You can't touch me!
You'll have money when you work for it.
What I'm not.
What do you know about me?
He's got nothing to do with me.
I'm telling you now.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
No, but I count them.  In a sock isn't new, you know?
You know what mortise and tenon is?
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
It's okay.
She needs to be alone, I think.
Because he put the lock on!  Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  I don't know anything, anymore!
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
One of you would end up dead.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
I want him with me.
I can't leave the house?
Let's go.
The first and the last.
Sam's favorite.
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
I can't pick you up.
You bit my finger.
'I'll be in the bedroom.'
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
Okay.
Can you stay for dinner?
I don't know what I'm doing.
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
He'll be gone for his birthday.
Dad said it first.
I just thought it would be nice.
Dad's home, already?
In the bedroom.
Nigger.
He's a big one.
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
You know, I'm fixing on retiring at the end of the summer, gonna try to enjoy what few years I have left. What do you think of this place? It's one of those new retirement communities down on the Gulf.
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
Here!
Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right back.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
I know it begins with a "C"...
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
Claude Banks.
You're soft.
Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
Forget it.
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
I said you're soft.
Say what?
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
I said you're soft.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
Remember what that place looked like on a sunny spring day? More beautiful than any church I was ever in.
You're the one who said that boneyard's the only way we're getting out of here. We're gonna join all the rest of 'em soon enough. Jangle Leg, Biscuit, Goldmouth, Poker Face, Cookie, Radio -- yes sir, pick a plot and start digging...
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
Gimme that damn thing.
Yeah? You and what army?
You ever done time before?
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
I try to moisturize regularly.
Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
Are you offering me a bribe?
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
You mother...
Don't do it!
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
Show him Central Park.
Try an angel.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
No.
I was DeNiro!
Andrew.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
The South.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
I think I'm floating.
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
That was Cassius!
From my dad's side of the family.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
See something you like, my man?
Yes. I would like my flask back.
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
Your turn.
Anything to eat?
Where do you send them?
You're a beautiful pair.
That's better.  How do you want us?
It'll be all right...
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
And I did it myself right on there.
Hurry... hurry... hurry.
Well... you can't have them all.
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
Here.
Why aren't you in Nursery?
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
I'm listening.
You're years away... I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them.  Want to try?
Maybe... sure...
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
A Runner gave it to me.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
But what is this -- why?
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
No. Not that either.
They won't listen.
Ycch.  To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Beloved wife...
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
What's that?
Gracious... no.
Have any other people ever passed through?
What makes you think so?
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
Good... You up for a drive?
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
What?
Yeah.
Yeah, I remember.
I can't see you tonight.
Okay.
Are you positive he knows?
What's he do?
Pete... Don't...
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this.
What happened to me?
Yes.
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
No... Here he comes.
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
Who is it?
Coming up.
Nothin'.
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
That's absurd.
Alice who?
What are you going to do?
I like to laugh, Fred.
No, nothing.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
From the club. You didn't answer.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
You were asleep when I got home, yes.
Yes, I just found it on the step.
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
Was there?
Which would you choose?
The heart, I guess.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
I can see that.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Whatiya mean?
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
A what?
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
Not at all.
Don't call me brother.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
I beg your pardon.
I see.
Look here—
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Will you stop squawking!
All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
Horns?
They were in a quandary, and—
In a quandary.
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
Gold. You were going to—
All right.
No.
Look, Bob!
Leaving?
Well - I'm—
Oh, yes.
That's intelligent.
You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
—buy and sell?
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Who?
He amputated his own leg?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
108 and still active?
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Well, then he's the man I want to see.  Will you come along?
Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"—  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
Hey!
Sondra Bizet.
We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder, would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure, would be doomed to destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing.  Look at the world today! Is there anything more pitiful?  What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other, propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. The time must come, my friend, when this orgy will spend itself, when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword. Against that time is why I avoided death and am here, and why you were brought here. For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here we shall be with their books and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be Kind.  When that day comes, it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world.  Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other, the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall inherit the earth.
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Why not? What's going to stop me?
Stay here?!  What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here.  I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?
I will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful!  Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here . . .
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
What do you suggest?
Where are we going? Huh?
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
You see, it's not a dream.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
It's Fenner.
We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?
Go? Where?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
You'll wait till you rot!
Please don't go.
Thank you.
It's not even a fucking door.
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
I guess I lost:
We're the government, Cowan.
What happens if I say no?
Three, huh?  Really? Cause a cup of coffee says we're talking about... number... four?  Huh?  No?
What?  I thought you just--
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
What?  Who the hell are you?
Why?  What are you gonna do?
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
Right.
So what's the problem?
I know, but we're on a college campus...
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Why?
Um-- Kay?
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
A what?
I think that's what's happening...
Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
You coulda told me what you were doing.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Why not?
Out of focus?
They respond to fear, right?
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
I figured it didn't matter.  It's my last day of business.   I was wrong.  I'm sorry.  Hey, look what I got for you-- a free-floating plasma pad? --One of the good ones, too, with zoids.
I dunno. One?
Nope.  Nothing at all.
Did he say where?
Actually, yeah--
I wanna make a deal.
But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
Elle's up in Portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a Trailblazers game.  Shots got a lot to mop up.  Tee says his Shanghai quadrasectionals haven't been around since morning.
Dee?  What are you doing here?
Did it leave?
Actually, I don't know...
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
Is it now?
The other two will die without me.
RUN!
Then who was he?
Somewhere.
Yeah --
Whatever you say, John.
Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
The nano... what?
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
... Graveyard shift.
Uh-huh...
I understand.  Sir.
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
And who the hell is that?
Everybody runs.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
To Hineman?
If it's a question of authority.
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
Then take her to Radio Shack.
I guess that's all of it.
What a big boy.  How old are you?
Wanna hear something funny?
Once I even told him I loved him.
Good-bye, Dad...
Sean, wait...
Tell me!
Good-bye, Crow.
I'm... not... a... killer.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
Why?
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
Hold that thought.
-- and then walk out.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
He also said Crow was a fake.
My God...
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
This murder is happening at two different times.
Precog Deja Vu...
I wanna kill my boss.
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
What?!
There's thousands of units like this one.
They're everywhere.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
No.  He can't...
What kind of cop were you before this?
None.  This was arranged.
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
Have you been there recently?
You mean after he lost your son.
But John was with him at the pool?
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
To what?  Trap him?
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
Yes, sir.
Are you sure?
What, sir?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
Holy shit.
Should I fuck him?
What time is it there?
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
I'm ready.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
I want you to take her with you.
What's your record at?
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
What's his name?
Where is this happening?
We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
You bet the ponies?
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
Soho.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
You don't know where you're going?
Depends what night.
I'm on the phone.
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
Can you check?
Shhh...
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
Seat belt.
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
What's the movie?
Maybe we should call for a cab.
No. Look. There.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
How much is it?
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
What are you doing?
You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
What did I 'get?'
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Where?
We're not getting whacked.
I'm your soldier.
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
We don't need guns.
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
What about it?
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
Bobby and Ricky.
Right, right. The 'thugs.'
You see a Ricky Slade?
You look good, man.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Ugh...
You really in trouble?
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
We're going to New York?
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
Goodbye.
Scotland.
Red, and I ain't no punk.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Why?
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
I'm working on it.
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Read it and keep on reading.
Who are you?
I sure met some.
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
What?
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
You have enough worries of your own.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
Is my family here yet?
I told you we don't know for certain.
You put it very well.
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
'Bout every other night, Red.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Get out.
Your control over your children, therefore --
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
...That isn't a whore?
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
You're too small to be Bogart.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in his pocket.
So what about him?
Might be all right.
You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
Yes sir.
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
No.
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
I'll call you tomorrow.
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
[Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
[The what?]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[How do I recognize him.]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
[Her life for your life.]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
[Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
[That's what everybody keeps saying.]
And what if amateurs try it?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
I came to visit you.
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
Oh...
Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
Yeah. Two or three.
I know you're not.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
[I think he's... magnificent.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
I already ate.
That's what friends do.
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
Which one was that?
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
Where?
Who told you that?
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
Were the lights on?
That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that all morning.
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
Come on inna dining room.
Nothing.
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
Sure, great if you ain't married.
Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
You gonna get married.
Marty...
You gonna die without a son.
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.
Sure.
She looks thirty-five, forty. She didn't look Italian to me.
She didn't look Italian to me.
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
Ah, my mother, she drives me crazy. I hadda beg her to let me drive her over here. The martyr. She always gotta be the big martyr.
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
Sure, sure.
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
He said it for us all, Walt.
Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.
Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
What the hell's going on here?
I don't drink intoxicants.
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
We been had.
Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
An application to Androscoggin College.
You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy.  You're a witness.
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
Ravenous. What about you?
Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
Sure, that's the right way... at John Hopkins or someplace. But how do we know there won't be even more of a jam-up a few days from now? Maybe we won't be able to get to him when we want to. Maybe the goddam thing'll erode the artery when nobody's looking. Our best shot is now.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
It's possible
Our minds?
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
Maria...
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
You guys got any black capsules?
I have not understood what you means.
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
Good morning.
Grab it, Eddie, grab it!
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
Thirty dollars.
John! I'm so glad to see you. I—I was terribly worried.
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
There is no letter.
There is no letter. I made it up.
Who, for instance?
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Where's Connell?
Yeah, a little.
Shut up!
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
Well, anyway, I—I guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
A gag. A gag!
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
You betcha.
Yeah. It certainly is.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd—
Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
That's a lie! Listen—don't believe what he says . . .
Did you write it—or didn't you?
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
Did you want to see her about something important?
Good night, John.
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Not that we know of.
You're my hero.
Dinner's on you.
Good. I don't want to be late.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
You're gettin' the car.
I think so.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
We lost.
You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
I ain't interested in your life story.
What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
You think I didn't need you?
If you did, you never showed it.
As a matter of fact, I do.
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
What?
Your concern is heartwarming.
His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.
Who's running it?
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
It's all been transferred.
To live forever.
Because I took it out of your memory.
-- If your life's so good up there Gena, what are you doing down here?
About what?
True.  But why?
Yes...
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
-- He won't.
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
The truth.
Times Square.
Yes.
You weren't real.
Yes.
Way you kiss me.
Just like that?
Speed?
Wait a second...  What time is it?
Ah... sure.
Yeah, right.
Everybody hold on tight.  We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!
... I just pray we're not too late.
In another time, another dimension.  It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies.  For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished.
Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
A stellar idea, Skull.
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
What do you mean "basically"?
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
LET'S DO IT!?
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
Scared.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
But if ya can't catch the guys...
That's it.
Why? You're the innocent one.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
How soon can we pull this off?
Didn't know you felt that way.
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.
I'll take care of the Boss.
I don't fuck my partners.
No worry, Charlie. I will kill them for you. No one will know.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
Masseria's been after me too.
A peaceful and prosperous retirement.
Shuddup.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
What'll it do if they pull the plug?
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
I need a new PR guy.
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
Who?
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
I don't <u>know</u>.
There's a thing here! There's a switch!
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
Dating anyone?
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
I can make my own decisions.
Mm hmm.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
This way?
Forty-five all total.
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
No!
What's this, Diz?
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
Yeah. Should have seen me seven years ago--when I came to this town. *Now* what am I?--chambermaid to the Pied Piper of Jackson City; *Honorary* appointment! Scratch this thing an you'll find they wanted a dope here for two months.
Sure--sure--wait a minute now--simmer down--
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
What do I play?
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
What dame?
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
Drunks are funny--
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
--followin' Miss Susan Fass-Pass around--his little heart poundin' away--the sound of angels' wings in his ears.
*All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Have *you*?
Well, let's get going.
My first name's--Clarissa.
No--not offhand--
Right now--everything I own--!
You know, we're getting married.
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
That infernal phone!
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
Now, pet--  Jim!
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
All right, why?
Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
No doubt. No doubt. And this fine little paper--"Boy Stuff"--with, I dare say, an *enormous* circulation in the State.
The--head?
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
I beg your pardon?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
Yes, I was--
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
Here--where are you running off to?
Will he yield for a question?
Mr. President--
Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
Gosh! You see sir--I was fixing some plaster for a cast on Amos' leg-- he's always chewing 'em off. I'll only be a minute--if you'll excuse me, sir--
Just fine.
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Office of--Senator Smith?
J-Jefferson Smith.
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
Right.
Pardon?
I don't see where we are *with* it.
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
I've got more. You better tell me.
In Terry Canyon?
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
What you *have* to do is fight!
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
No--I mean--yes--that is--
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
"So help me God."
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.
Swell!
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
What! Who?
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
So I go right back where I was-- carrying compromises--covering up-- back to political tricks--this time for--! No! I was just getting rid of all that. If I did *anything*, I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--. No! I don't want any part of it! Smith or anything else! I'm all through. I want to be left alone!
That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
Jim, you don't have to--
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
Anything *better* to offer?
Maybe he won't get up.
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
What's that got to do with it?
What's that got to do with it?
Yes!!!
Well, I guess I walked too much. I've been looking for a job all day. I found one, too. I start tomorrow.  You've been awfully kind. Thank you very much.
What did they say?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
What did they say?
It's wonderful.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Really?
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
You threw them out!
No, I don't mind.
Nothing.
Don't be ridiculous.
Can I have a month's vacation?
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
You're crazy! You can't do that!
That's the rub.
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
Close that door.  Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Let me go!
See you later, kid.
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Yes.
When?
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.
Why should you?
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Only common sense.
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Oh.
Oh, they insisted on following me.
Are those stories true?
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
Well, thanks, I - uh—  How do you do? What is your name?
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Yes?
Take the stand!
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Now you keep out of this!
Yes, ma'am.
Oh. Oh!
Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
I did what!
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
What, sir?
Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir.
Why are they ganging up against me?
Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
But you do therapy?
Not any more.
I think he's got a point.
So... the University of Kentucky. Who runs the program down there?
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
It's a thought I had.
Should I open it now?
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
But you did come to me.
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
What do you do?
Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower.
Yeah.
It was Henry Follett.
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
It's a pretty piece of land.
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
Why do you watch?
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Sure.
Got a license?  But no car?
I just got my license two weeks ago.
You're good.
Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.
Do you think that's a good idea?
No, I really don't.
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
Is that like a party trick?
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
And this is legitimate therapy?
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you.  Not one who's treating me, of course.  And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence.
You probably got the idea.
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...
What'd he say?
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
I trust you. Definitely. No question. But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you?
Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.  And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
It wasn't the best situation.
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
See you Thursday... regular time.
You're completely reliable.
You want my advice? Far out!
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
What'd I do?
Excuse me?
Did you say 'kill' my sister?
Even?
Sounds familiar.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
Do you know where I can steal some?
You shall see.
Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book...  And your sister.
Yeah! Them.
What is he doing here?
Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us?
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
What did you do to him!?
Twenty.
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
Want to know?
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
I know my treasure.
Oh that's comforting.
Why would I do that?
Very slowly.
I have no choice.
And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.
Still...
Well neither do I, thank you.
Oh.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
Um-hmm.
Your mind is so slippery.
Head hunting.
So who killed him?
I was eight.
Atta, boy!
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
But in fact... you'd found it.
Me, too.
Sure.
I got it.
Why bother?
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
Too bad. PLUG HIM!
Just a waitress.
Why not?
Me, too.
Yes.
When are you going to take off that mask?
My heart died a long time ago.
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
How could I see him if he's invisible?
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
Are you coming or not?
I'll drive.
Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand!
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
Oh shut up.
The Eradicators!
Oh hi, Mom.
Looking for... the TV Guide.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Or Batman --
Through there!
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
What do you mean?
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
I wanted to kiss her, but she didn't want to kiss me... She slipped away, the moment I wanted to take her in my arms.
Yes, sir.
No, sir, none at all.
Have you been back recently?
It is the work of incendiaries.
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
No, sir.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
My mind is made up.  She will not set foot in my house again.  I think if I saw her again, I might be tempted to strangle her.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
I cannot promise you that.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
Will you be joining us, soon?
In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.
I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
There's probably some explanation.
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
What are you talking about?
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
About Hippolyte Charles.
My God, what do you think?
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
Oh, then you are...
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
Anything you need.
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
Y'all never use it?
I don't know!
Yup.
No we didn't.  We came to buy a CD.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
Damn, you got a stalker.
You don't know Baby D.
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
Big bitches need love, too, Craig.
Ain't no windows in here.
That ain't gonna work.
Still gonna smell it.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
I don't know.
What you mean, you don't know?  Just wait here.
Yes I did.  Excuse me.
Why didn't she put'em out?
I said hold on!
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta hit the high-way!
It ain't about being a punk, son.  It's about this...
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
I said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy?
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
I got fired too.
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
What urgent message?
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
I got my mase.
I threw my back, again.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
What's he doing here?
What?
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
Indeed.
For not believing you.
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
Tell me why he's dead.
What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
To be a hero?
Is within himself.
I remember. The big tipper.
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
I don't know.
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.
Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.
I've got something for you.
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
You're wasting time.
Just put her on.
Hm!
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
Keep talkin', Preacher.
And I won't never tell about the money.
And the times that are gone by. I'll have her ready inside of a week; and then we'll go fishin'. How's your Maw?
But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
How do you mean?
Say what, Walt Spoon!
Walt!
Mother, I only --
I'll be switched!...
Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. Never caught the gypsies nor the horse.
Come on!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
Mister Powell!
She'd found this fruit jar of dandelion wine  that the husband -- Harper -- had hid somewheres in the cellar.  She was drinking.
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Sshhh...
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
Come on, children!
I don't know nothin'!
Yes?
What secret shall I tell?
That's no secret. I'm five.
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
O' course.
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
Them kids is yours?
My flesh and blood!
The man! The man!
Because he was scary, that's why.
Okay, okay.  I think.
Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.
What!?
He's dangerous.
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
I don't mean her --
Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room!  Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.
Warm milk. Gross.
Yes, Mother. G'night.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
Nobody's gonna kill you.
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
No more fights?
Good evening, Ninotchka.
An evening gown.
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
Or we can't go back to Russia!
I can tell you exactly.
How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
That's another thing... it's spring.
...des raisins de Madère, des framboises... 
I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
Don't worry... there will be enough.
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
The former Duchess!
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
Very well, Your Highness.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance.
I just said let's have a little lunch.  Room service.
What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
Just looking around.
That's even better.
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring, didn't we? We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
Confess what?
No visa.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
You're going to force us... huh?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Me?
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
That is correct.
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
I didn't follow you.
What are you after?
What?
On which boat?
Probably not.
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
You see? Life can be so simple.
No... go on.
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
No. Nobody will find us.
All right, we'll make it red.
No! No!
...and we won't clench our fist...
Much happier.
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
Please.
Yes, sweetheart. 
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Oh, Leon!
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Shhh!  ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know!
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Yes.
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
Where are they?
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
What do you want?
May I have your bags, madame?
Yes, it does.
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow.
At Père Mathieu's.
My jewels?!
He told me to take you to his conference room.
I agree it's ridiculous but --
Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
Why me?
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
Yeah?
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
And?
Pay him.
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
Not like the others -- Dean, McCord, the rest ... We never got our side of the story out, Al.  People've forgotten.  I mean: "Fuck you, Mr. President, fuck you Tricia, fuck you Julie!" and all that shit, just words, but what violence!  The tear gassing, the riots, burning the draft cards, Black Panthers -- we fixed it, Al, and they hate me for it -- the double dealing bastards.  They lionize that traitor, Ellsberg, for stealing secrets, but they jump all over me 'cause it's Nixon.  ... They've always hated Nixon.
You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now, sir, but ... but you need to get out more, sir, and talk to the people.  No one I know feels ... close to you.
That's what they're doing.
And if I stay?
How do you see this?
I don't know anything about that.
I know it well, sir.
Their fourth!
That fruitcake!  What about him?
What's Liddy got?
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
Yeah, but Roselli wasn't just any gangster.  He was the gangster who set up Track 2 in Cuba.
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
Sir?
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
It's the parents' fault really.
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
Townsend gave us 300 grand.  Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ...
Yes, Mother ...
Harold may have lost touch with his Bible, but thou must never lapse.
I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
I expect more from thee, Richard.
Thou must.
I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.
No.
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
I never met the man.
We took his system out.
Who do you think is behind it?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
Personally, I'll be calling the President of the United States.
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
Agreed.
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
What I think is ... they're cowards. Their opposition represents the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment.  They don't realize as you do, Mr. President, that the Communists only respect strength, and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the "madman," Richard Nixon.
No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
Free, if you're the president.
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
You're shittin' me.
Ernie Davis.
Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
Maybe I am.
What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
I'll concede in the morning.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
Do you really want this, Dick?
And then you'll be happy?
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
They're all your enemies?
Yes!
And what am I doing?
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
The "crises"?
Some say you are, Rocky.
'Predate it.
How fresh is this coffee?
In Angola. Yeah.
You don't know what he thinks.
Yes I do.
Believe it was that night. She buried him the next mornin'.  Diggin' in that hard caliche.
You're discouraged.
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
The old boy shot by the highway?
Llewelyn Moss?
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Yessir.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
I mean, would you care to join me.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
Goin' out.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
What should I do?
You know what's goin' on?
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
I can hear it in your voice.
I know where the money is.
I can't say.
Where does he work?
Why would I care where you're going.
Yeah? Where am I?
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
All right.
You know she won't be there.
With what?
Well... I need to see about closin'.
Yessir.
Generally around dark. At dark.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
Half.
I do like you.
Were you in Nam?
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
It wasn't a woman.
I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
You must be joking.
Do you know why I'm here?
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
Umm, I don't think that...
I better go check on them.
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah, me too.
I gotta go make dinner.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
Of course.
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
...did I win some contest?
He has no heartbeat!
The one you were telling me about?
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
How many men have I talked to?
IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
Fine. You got five...
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Like what?
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing, will you?
I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
...that's a good motto.
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
Like... us?
Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
I said 'got it?'
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
What do you mean?
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
You better believe it.
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Oh fuck...
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
David Ravell.
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
Her show?
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
Fire! I hate fire!
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Latch right on to that tit.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
Vernon T. Waldrip.
Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
You -
Well, we need that ring.
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
I am. Hur you?
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
Well I guess folks don't mind they's integrated.
I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.  C'mon. Let's go get your luggage.
I been calling for four months.
Great.
I never said any of that!
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
Well, goodbye.
I called you Sarge.
Before that.
No, sir!
Yes, sir!
We don't have to talk at all.
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Yeah... Mmmm...
You hope.
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Not me.
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
I'll get it if you want.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want.
Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?
Yeah. All week long.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
Shhhh...
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?
You know how this gotta end.
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
Fourteen business days.  Escrow is always business days.
You're an idiot.
This is insane.  I'm outta here.
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
And we're never getting in.
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
Everything okay?
No, you can't come in.
The sentence that started "There are three."  What was the rest?
Master closet.
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
I said open the door.
What is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  You're a bus driver, "Homes," you live in Flatbush, so please don't start spouting some Elmore Leonard shit you just heard because I saw that movie too,
The hell we are.
No, Edgar Allen.
What's to keep them from prying open the door?
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Little bit.  Yeah.
Why did the chicken cross the road?
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
I'm sorry, Mom.
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
Who? I mean besides the FBI?
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
No sir he didn't.
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
Wait a second there brother...
Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
Brimmer.
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
Nothing.
What are you saying?
Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
You believe that?
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
Congratulations.
Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
We've got plenty of baking powder. You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago.
Goodbye.
Lovely.
My pleasure, sir.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
Most certainly.  Arrange it.
The middle colonies?
And the Governor?
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them.
I have no choice, I...
Flanking riders?
You learned her lessons better than I.
It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
Seven homes along the Black River so far...
Please.
Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
It's Mister Marion.
That's a damn long time...
Balderdash!
That's five, keep going...
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
Thank you.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
It is ended.
Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
Yes, he does.
I've had no sons to lose, nor daughters.  I lose the sons of other men.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Is that right, dad?
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.
Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
Then come on.
We're still not where we're going.
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
You want to rest a bit before you start?
Because it's right.
Yes.
Why, then, things should be fine.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
And because the dead walked.
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
Leave me alone!
You don't understand--
Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow.
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
That's forgotten.
That boat is my livelihood!
Aye, aye, sir!
Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
All right then.
Or you could surrender.
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
I'm a bit nervous, myself --
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
That would hardly be proper.
Yes -- yes.
Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
It doesn't!
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
More to drink!
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
Nor did you, I noticed.
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
What?  He never told me that.
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me.
I'd die for her.
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
I swear, you look just like him.
The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
Yes.
... No.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
You'll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched.  Poppy?
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
You think you can use me to stop the meltdown.
You're not rotting meat.
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
Then you still love me?
Poppy, this is not the time!
Shut up and do it!
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
You're looking for a urine sample.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
Really?  What have you been doing?
The big house.
I guess I should be flattered.
It was a long time ago, Daniel.  We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
Yeah, we'll see.
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
Then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure.
What?  What's wrong?
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
No problem.
What did you want my hair for?
I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
Do the words 'hero fantasies' mean anything to you?  How about 'infantile dementia'?
You were looking for us?
An ass-beating.  Would you like yours first, Mr. Sim?
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
And you have him?
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities.  I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out.
Yes, he might be.
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
You may go, Smythe.
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room.
Gallagher!
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
Stewart!
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
Is that so?
We were classmates.
That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it.
I'm afraid.
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
No?
'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see—'  Tweet, tweet - ha, ha—
Dawson, sir.
Oh no, sir!
Thank you, sir.
But not for me!  Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
I dyed one and washed the other.
Staring at us?
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
Very good.
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
What did he want?
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
With pleasure, Madame!
All right, Grandma—
Yes - the worm!
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
I know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Thanks.
Yes.
Okay.
What?
And they won't be able to tell?
I had to say goodbye.
I won't.
I'm sorry ...
Here's my favorite.
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
Oh yeah.
You want to get out of here?
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
What's the matter?
No. What?
One of those ... big beds?
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
We prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary.
You're not allowed to lie.
Why am I out of order?
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
No it isn't.
The other one?
No way.
YOU get lost!
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
As a matter of fact he does.
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Not directly anyhow ...
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
... Yeah.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
Rain.
We'll just put up the top.
Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
We'll get you fixed up in no time.
Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
... Like Prince Charming.
McGinty's.
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
... Hi.
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
NOW!
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
Why?
I'm so glad you're here.
Why?
Hi.
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore.
Cool.
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
D&D Mattress Man.
Why?
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
I'm trying to be your friend.
Why?
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I don't know.
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
Why's it here?
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
Are your pants off?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
Really? Please?
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
No. I'm sorry.
Why did you tell me you did, then?
You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
I don't know.
I think that'll be fine.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Thank you.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
Sure.
Alright?
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Ok.
...yeah...
yeah.
Yeah......yeah.....
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
Yeah.
I think maybe over a hundred.
What is this?
You can't do that.
For what?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
Did you do it?
No.
No.
I don't know.
Your hand is bleeding.
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
I don't know if there's anything wrong with me because I don't know how other people are.....Sometimes I cry a lot.....for no reason.
It takes time to process --
Yeah.
You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
What is this, man?
I know.
Yes, yes, right.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
I'm only paying two of you guys.
Just tell him to call me.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
Should I call you later?
I'm afraid that our endowment has shrivelled to a mere pittance; we're the laughing stock of all France. But -- on a happier note --
We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion.
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
Not now, or we're both done for.
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
I'll fill page after page, I promise.
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
They can't be serious.
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
THEN BUGGER ME!
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
And his writing?
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
It was not inspired by circumstance.
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
I'll fill every slippery hollow; if you're obliging, then you'll swallow!
Come now, darling, give it a read.
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
"Well worth the dig!"
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
Is it awfully violent?
I don't believe it!
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
Oh, but I am!
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
I'd rather read, thank-you.
I wonder sometimes.
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
Don't insult me with your cute press quotes Save it for Louella.
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
My name is Orson Welles
So I've been told.
I'll remember that.
So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind of sad future are we two making? A future where men will do anything to sell their newspapers and their movies? A future where no price is too high for fame and power? When we will all scratch each other to pieces just to be heard?
There certainly is I There certainly is! Aw, to hell with you!
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
I will not have this in my home.
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
I don't want you to--
Sir?
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
You drink at 10 am, do you?
He personally asked you to?
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
He's nothing but a hypocrite. He preaches morality every day in his sordid little papers for everyone else in the world but he lives openly with his mistress.
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
Listen to me-
I don't have it anymore?!
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
I'll hire you  -- right now-
He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
What?
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
Uh huh.
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
It's too late. The movie's made
Kinda.
Herman.
Yes.
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
Please don't ask me to do this.
I'm Christ
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
Nothing...
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
Huh?
Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about.
Three more, I figure.
Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
I never noticed his face.
Positive.
What'd you see?
Jake --
No. Open the door.
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
His wife took a trip.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
-- until yesterday morning.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
Give him evidence.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
Like what?
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
For what?
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
Like what?
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
It's me.
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
Yeah.
I don't know what you mean.
That's a start. I'm at the Brevoort now. I'll be looking for you.
That's abnormal.
Stella!
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
Unless he's dumber than I think, he won't wait 'til his lease is up.
To bail Lisa out of jail.
How much do you think you'll need?
Who's Thorwald?
For yourself -- and me.  I could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow... fashion, portraits --
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.
You might have to, if you went with me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero?
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
I wouldn't dare answer that.
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
Not yet!
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
He's washing down the bathroom walls.
It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
Too close.
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Phone number?
Glad to meet you.
Okay.
Down in back.
I think I should go home.
No.
Yes.
I don't want to learn that!
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
You don't?
Have some cigars.
I was talking to Jim.
That's right!
Stay here.  That was my son!
Yes, sir.
Head-shrinker?
Why don't you come back tomorrow, son?  Ever been booked before?
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
No.  In the morning.
It's me!
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
No.  I'm scared.
Come on!
Your father!
Get away from me!
I shot at one of them.
I can't keep it to myself anymore--
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
Chicken?
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Bully for you.
"Life is crushing in on me."
You going there?
Why?
I'm never going back.
You decide, darling.  Remember our budget.
I bet you hear everything I say!
Hi.
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
He hates me.
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  Did you notify the parents?
What are you doing here?!
Gabriel!
Please, Gabriel, don't...
YES!!!
No, baby. He wants me.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
He'll be dead when he does.
I don't think it's negative five.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
We could live it up and --
NICK!
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
I love you!
Get your own room.
I love you, Nick...
They all are. Football's on.
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
Yes!
I never worked at no casino.
She says a lot of things.
Bam Bam.
A station wagon in Canada.
Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you.
Might as well be.
You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.
And where they hide the real money.
I don't know... what you're...
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
Where is he?! Where is he?!
OPEN IT!!!
GO!!!
What?
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
You gotta get someone upstairs.
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
I promise you, I didn't know!
Hell you haven't.
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
Standing right here, man!
Tell Ashley... I...
You gave them me.
I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
Bullshit.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
The Brewers.
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
But what is this?
Take a seat.
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
Why am I Mr. Pink?
Cause you're a faggot, alright?
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
No, they're not.
You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more.
Don't ask me that.
He don't tip.
We think we got a rat in the house.
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
You don't believe in tipping?
Fuck all that.
Dead.
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
You really think we were set up?
A few cops.
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
I got the diamonds.
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
That was the plan, we meet here.
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?
Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
Well, he knows a little about me.
He asked.
You takin' his side?
There's a slight difference.
You can stay here if you like.
That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
It's too light yet.
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
And meet him there.
Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up.
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
There's a lot of things I don't see any sense to. But make up your mind. Learn to read or --  -- go back and watch the horses.
You want to split up? --
I can't take her with me.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
There aren't any women here.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
Depends on how good you drive.
I don't like to see you go.
He certainly could. About a month.
Please. Maybe he'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses.
Who brought you here?
I said I had a guy to see and I'm going to see him.
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
I was doin' both. Here.
Let me do that.
If you need me, I'll be --
No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's...
I think he wants me.
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
Psychology.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
You sure?
Okay.
No. I never date outside my race.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Sure. We can practice talking.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
I think so.
That means more screen time for us.
I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
Um, I'm not touching anything.
This can't be happening?
Quick, everyone to the lab.
Oh.
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
You better go get Dwight and the Professor.
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
My help?
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
What happened?
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
You scared me.
This is so silly. 
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. 
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Oh, honey!
...People who don't mind their own business.
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
I didn't do it!
Socially... I'll have a beer.
So you admit you just lied?
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
You got your wish.
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Yes you are.
No. It's my father -- I wanted to talk to you -- you wrote about cures --
About forty-five dollars.
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
What circumstances?
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
I can't understand it at all.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village —-	"The Dante."
And that was all?
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
I saw him on the floor. He was cut -—  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him —— white —— and the men holding him up between them.
We've tried so long to find her.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
Good-bye.
It's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
It's here, too.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ——	one as a detective.
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
Yes. You know the devil and all his minions are marked that way.
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
I didn't know.
She's not been here for a long time.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
What did he say?
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
Yes?
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Sister older or younger?
Who's Elizabeth?
Okay, I will!!
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
Kids? What about them?
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
What?
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
Nothing I can't finish later.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
Who's Donna?
Not really.
Because I promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
What do you have to do to get ready?
What will you do when the money runs out?
Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!
On tape?
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
I'm not in love with you.
I want to know why you are the way you are!
No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
I ate by myself.
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
Yes.
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
Did you do anything?
What visitor?
Is he still at your house?
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
That you are under no obligation to me?
Yes.
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Why?
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
I have a pretty good idea.
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
I don't want to talk about it.
Then why'd you call me?
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
No, but I did.
Why?
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
How did you find me?
Spooked.
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
Different.
I can't talk you into it?
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
Right.
I'm intrigued.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
You told Ann about this?
I wish you hadn't done that.
It hurts that you would say that to me.
Who?
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
How about for five hundred?
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
You have family here also?
Or go someplace in a hurry.
What tapes?
No.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
Brian Kirkland, please.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.
Well? Supper at my place?
Down to the incinerator.
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
Well, at least you still talk the same.
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
I got it!  I got it!!!
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
Well, Betty, there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly...
Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.
Now Betty, don't overreact.
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
I don't want to get up there.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
Absolutely correct.
What do you mean?
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
Why?
I can't wear anything under it. That would spoil the line.
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
F for...
Foods!
YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU'RE NO GOOD
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
We're not confused.
We love you, Baby.
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Stephanie.
Great. You look great.  You both do.
No, I'm an actor.
You are not.
I can't help the traffic.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
Now.
Just a minute!
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
Then it's a good thing.
And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
Fuck you.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
I'm a quick learner.
Well, she is cute.
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
I'm fine!
Bathroom.
Okay! Jesus!
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
Oh yeah. Sure.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Just trying to be helpful.  It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet.
I said okay?
Let's leave it alone.
I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
What?
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
The plan is... you go.
Hrnrnrn?
No, I'm okay.
I feel like driving.
You were wearing your belt.
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
The Windmill.
Hey.
Yeah, I know.
What about me?
Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
Well, nice to see you now.
You too.
I'm sure he believed every word.
Oh, Maya. No.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
Both.
Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.
No dad!
He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
Good.
...Tell Graham --
Are you going to do this or what?
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
Eleven a.m. They're gone.
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
Got it!
It's getting stronger.
I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
It needs batteries.
You're scaring your sister.
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
Yeah.
Don't worry.
What book!
Your next water ain't for three days.
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
They've been kind to me.
And you're not Baxter, either?
All right. I'm looking for a young fella, full of juice. About my size, wears a fancy two-gun rig.
Ten A.M.
Right... I thought they always did it at dawn.  So long, kid. I'm sorry.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
I'll be long gone.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
South of here, past Chimayo.
All right, you buy me a drink.
Anybody got any ideas?
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
What happened?
And a pretty lady.
Why?
What's that?
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
Who is he?
All I did was kiss the girl.
We'd rather stay.
You're kidding.
Daddy's dead.
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
I heard that too.
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
So we understand each other?
Yeah, maybe I will too.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
You like a good saloon?
So-called?
That was my plan.
I thought you two would get along.
He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
Of course.
And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Okay -- for you.
Excuse us.
Please.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
Almost right.
"Forever".
What about it?
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Simone does not control my destiny.
-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear.  I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
I do?
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Do what you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
You're with me to be close to her?
Of course, the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more.
And what may I ask brought this on?
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
You want me to call Security?
"Straw God" changed my life.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
Me too.
You know, I... don't know.
I know plenty of boys.
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
I love you too, daddy.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
Lainey...
This is the story.
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
They are alive, Sayer.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it?  What is it -- drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? All three?  What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
Taller, Viktor.
Taller?  What?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
A star is...
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
Nothing bad can happen in a church, right?
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
Why?
That I'm a freak.
Yeah. Sorry.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Me too.
Why don't you think about it for a while?
Yes, I am.
No, we're not.
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
What?
They used to hang people here.
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
What are you talking about?
Superstition.
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
Bitch.
No shit.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
Old Macdonald had some... MOONSHINE!
Pardon?
This is his room... isn't it?
People say he was a murderer.
That's your grandfather you're talking about!  I... know what people say. Heard it... all my life.
Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?!
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
Not at all. They lynched my ancestors, they smell like manure, they have sex with their relatives... and they all have two first names: "Bobby- Joe" --
Fuck you! Who cares what sandwich the bitch was eating?
Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
Don't look.
Never.
Us? We been... moonlighting.
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
'Mornin', Jack.
I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
Aspirin.
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
Shelby --
Hell, I was game!
Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.
Brought you munchies.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
You're my princess, aren't you?
I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
It's just one of my students, Grant.
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Gold--digger, huh?
Hey, look!
How much style?
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
By stealing my car?
You might have said no. I have trouble handling rejection.
Like what?
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks.
Or in the slammer.
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
But I still don't think...
Go.
Let's keep it that way.
Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.
I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
Do I have a choice?
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
What's that, pardner?
Go breaker.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
What else?  Can you give me cover, Mister B?
Uh, yeah.
Mmm-hmm.
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
Without peer?
That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.
-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
...He does now...
Yes. The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot, the man that plunged to his death from the Penthouse yesterday. He was to neutralize Israel's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart. Ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself on-site with the assistance of Dr. Gregory Gill, Israel's personal physician, who was also on the Sparazza payroll.
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
Yeah, I can front this.
Right, you got clicks, anything?
It's gettin' done Sid.
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
True?
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
Security's locking down the elevators.
...What are they doin' right now...?
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
Can it work?
We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
Will she come back?
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
Not necessarily.
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
Yes.
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
To calm your anxiety.
Yes.
All right.  How about I feel better when you take them?
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
When?  When I'm asleep?
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
I'm just as human as you.  I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do.
Do you?
It wouldn't have made any difference.
I can't --
You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
Right.  That's true.
Can we go then?
How did you know?
No dog.
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
I'll miss you, Mike...
Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
Not if you don't want me to.
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
I don't know Tommy.
What?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
You don't want to hear about it.
I think -- she's crazy.
I might stop you.
Where'd you get the tie?
What did she say the down payment was?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
She bought it.
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!
I'm sorry.
You talked to his wife?
I heard.
Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
Remember Little League?
Don't be pitiful.
Mm-hmm.
That's not even close.
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Mr. Jameson--
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
How about tomorrow?
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
Just call me Spidey.
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
I've gotta study.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
Oh, don't do it on my account--
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
I think I'd like that.
You'd feel what?
So you've found Thorkel?
I'm a photographer, remember?
It'll shut itself off.
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
I don't care.  Cretin.
Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
Phooey on that.
I'm not so happy myself.
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.
Coming up.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
You betcha. I said one of us is a stoolie. A dirty, stinkin' stoolie!
Twenty-five.
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
Sefton!
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --
And this?
Stop it, Harry!
They'll shoot you, Animal!
Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
You clocked him! Why don't I clock you?
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
She'll never forgive me!
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
Why, sure!
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
Are we boring you?
Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
I called it the last time, didn't I?
He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
I'll kill you for that!
December seventh, forty-one.
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket.
Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
Twelve years, sir.
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
I was attempting to get in the spirit of things. I thought it would be humorous.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
Thanks.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
Why would you want to leave?
It's our pleasure.
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
Yes.  Thank you.
I always do.
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
I was ordered to by the Captain.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
No, sir.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
The Nexus.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
In code to STARFLEET... Captain's Spock's tube located intact on Genesis surface. Will relay more data on subsequent orbits.
What is it?
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
It's a little early to celebrate.
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
Sir...?
Aye, sir!
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
Yes. And I know you.
You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?!
About a dozen officers and men.
... The needs of the few...
Yes... But -- how...?
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
Steady. Continue on impulse power.
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
I have my orders.
The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
But we can't just sit here -- !
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
There's an air-lock.
What's the matter -- ?
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
We appear to have plenty of time.
What?
They're still running with shields down.
No!
I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
Do it, while we have time.
Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
In my quarters, Uhura.
And why not?
There is no such regulation.
Try again.
Ready, sir.
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
Aye, sir.
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
We've done it before.
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
I liked him better before he died.
Then how.?
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
Like what?
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
Shields, aye.
May fortune favor the foolish.  Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
Then --
Implicitly.
Just lucky, I guess.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Hm?
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
... Damn!
A spaceship with a missing man.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Why does it have to be goodbye?
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
In progress, Admiral.
How do you know this...?
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
Exaggerate.
He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
They did, Admiral.
Then... Where the hell are we?
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
What is our condition?
Picture, please.
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Aye, sir!
Uhura!... Where!
Put them on screen!
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Humpbacked - people.?
How long, Scotty?
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Full power, sir.
Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
Sill? What else would I be working with?
It is kind of you to make this effort.
If I were in your shoes, I'd feel the same way after what happened.  The 'artificial lifeform' is a member of my crew. Apparently, he became... ill...
There are days.
You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be?  But some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven't.
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
A perfect moment?
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
I understand.
My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change.  I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet...
If not for Data, you'd probably have been re-located by now.
And our people?
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
Sure it is. And your hair is still chestnut brown.
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
I'm not begging for my life. I'm begging for yours.  There is still a way home, Gal'na.
We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
That's your expert opinion?
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
You've not aged a day since then?
Ask them.
The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...
Sir?
Make it so.
Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
Transferring controls to manual.
No, sir. It is a gorch.
Is there any other way to disable the injector?
They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
No children?
But it's comfortable.
You're in quite a mood today.
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
It'll have to wait. Come on.
Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
Ready.
Initiate pre-ignition sequence.
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Great name. French?
The invasion plans.
You're lying.
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
That's impossible.
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you.  Don't stop now.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Aye, sir.
Fire!
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Emergency override!
Riker here.
Target...
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?
We're not finished.
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
Stand...?
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
That's a comfort...
He just tried to save him!
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
I am.
So if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination - ?
She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
You tell them, Lieutenant.
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Thank you, Captain.
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
I shall look forward to it.
We must do this again soon.
They'll be here...
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Possibly.
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Mr. Chekov, anything unusual?
You hear that?
This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat  Enterprise surrenders --
That the universe will unfold as it should.
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
That could take hours!
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
No.
No. Can I move now?
If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency.  There’s no crying in Starfleet.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open!
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
Fire!
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
How can you be sure?
Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
Negative.
I know how he thinks.
This isn't about me anymore.
Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.
Theories?
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
We’ve got him!
Aye, sir.
That's an order, Commander.
On screen.

Not with the Romulans.
I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates.
If you don't mind.
Not yet, Mister Worf.
On screen.
Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
It's working.
We can only hope so.
He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
She's the most beautiful ship I’ve ever seen.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
What happened?
You'll acquire a taste for it.
How did you end up on Remus?
No race should be a slave to another.
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
I was lonely...
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
And what of the Enterprise?
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?
He's a very unusual android.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
No -- this is wasting time.
Do as I tell you!
A matter of hours now.
You don't have to understand.
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
Sure.
No.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Where's that?
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
When can we expect containment?
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that.
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
Dashboard.
Money.
What are you doing?
Horses.
Three nights... two days.
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you.
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
Yes?
Please stay.
On the radio they say it's good.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
I feel better if I move.
We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
What for?
I understand.  Thank you.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
No, sir. Radar.
It was a man though... right?
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
You saw that?
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
Jesus.
Watch and see.
I'm already hurting.
It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
Clips.
Least you can do.
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
I'm on her.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
Is he dead?
Okay... what about Strickland?
What do you mean?
I intend to.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
She still loves me.
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
So that gives you something.
Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
That's where it gets a little strange.
Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
Take the tape to the cops.
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
Hi there.
Winona.
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
Yeah.
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
Just an observer.
MyDick.
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
What I do requires confidentiality.
I'm hesitant to...
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
I was looking for a pattern.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I didn't use Low's name.
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
How long have you been downtown?
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
Yes.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
Yeah.
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
So you're the new meat?
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
You've been through worse.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
It didn't feel that way.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
Yeah.
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Hi.
Why? You're not a real man?
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
To do what?
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
...not until you book it...
...and even then...
...you might get cut out.
What else is going on?
...And she's with someone else.
The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Why not?
It's a rebound.
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
How are you doing?
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
Goodbye. I lov... 
You don't call.
Unless she comes back first.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
Classy.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
Well, that's dumb.
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
They turned you down?
I didn't make it...
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
You asshole.
What are they doing here?
Wow, I guess you were home... 
I'm not going to Vegas.
Shut up -- yes you are. Now listen to Tee. We'll stop at a cash machine on the way.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
Did she, or did she not smile?
It doesn't matter...
Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.
Yes!
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
This version doesn't have fighting?
...It looked money.
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
She didn't see.
Now?
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...You're just poking at it...
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep.
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
...it's definitely on.
You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
Yes. 
And what is that Bonasera?
I'll come to you when I need you.
You have to answer for Santino.
Your girl friend.  She says she can't make it tonight.  You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard!
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
Understood.
Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
And this?
For killing a man.
No, I wanted other things for you.
What else do you believe in?
Yes.
You want him to stay in this country.
Godfather, you understand everything.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
How do you know I come from America?
And when they shot me father...
Right.
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
Have you agreed on a meeting?
They're waiting to see my father.
You like spaghetti?
Tell me you love me.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
I want you to go back to New Hampshire...think things over.
How's Mom?
I can help you out...
Is it like they say?  Is he that good?
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
You think I scam?
We?
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
Shut up.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
Yes please!
Say again?
I met him in New York.
What?
Oh God -- I can just imagine -- if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? Never! I swear on your ring, Marge. I am never going back.
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something. Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni.
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
Freddie drove me back in his car.
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
I've got plans!
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
It's superb.
So I'm learning.
I'll go and see what's the matter.
I'll go.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
You were going to Venice.
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
What?
Tom.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
I don't believe you.
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
As in the...?
Randall.
Is Freddie in Rome?
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
We'll be there.
It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
You try. You try talking to her.
What about Thomas Ripley?
November, I thought.
No!
No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.
I have!
Tomorrow.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
I know. I could have picked you up.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
It keeps ya busy.
You know what you remind me of?
The singer?
I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
Can I call you?
Yeah.
Just what?
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
Is he Italian?
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Could you see anything?
The cops and company raise hell they find out.
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
Support my kids. Can you dig it?  Nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me. 
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
Easy.
What's your real name?
I don't like my real name.
What's your real name?
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
I can leave anytime I want.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
He looks like a killer.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
Yeah.
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.
What do you mean?
My work may take me out of New York.
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
There must be something...
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Education?
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
Funny, you don't look hip. 
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
The taxi life, you mean.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Thanks.
You suppose?
Now they only have three rockets left.
It's about time.
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
Dad... 
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
Me too.
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Exactly.  And he got good.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
Yes.
No, sir.
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
By all means.
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
You think it over.  No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.
And... what's my name again?
Why?
Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here.
Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
... Ernie.
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
Yes?
They're...
Oh, no, I...
Bought the bottle, didn't I?  To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
The G-man?
No, sir.
Well, at least you remember "Moby Dick."
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
Can we get him to the hospital?
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
No, of course not, why should you be sorry?  You're the new Peter Appleton.  You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that.  Very noble.
Not any more.
What do you mean?
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
They will.  They w-w-will.
You mean, he was... let go, too?
Got any money?
No.  Absolutely not.
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
Yes.
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?
All right. 
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
I don't understand.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
That's up to you.
They're birds!
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
It's a surprise, you see.
Yep?
Thank you.
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
Where will we go?
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
Do I sound foolish to you?
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
I don't mind, really.
We know what it is, Al.
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
I didn't break that window!
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
Look, Mr. Brenner...
What?
Oh, yes.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
So you didn't go to school together.
Yes.
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
Like what?
No, I have my things in the car.
Are you staying?
What do you mean?
At Annie's house. She's all right.
Wait here. Don't move.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable.  Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?
That would hardly be possible.
The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things.
Can't you please finish your drink?
I'm only a student.
It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
You'll be a good doctor.  I know all about doctors.
An old acquaintance, eh?
But you'll have to stand great pain, Georgina.  Greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of your sickness.  Do you want it that much?
A doctor?
That's a good boy, Toddy.
I've had some experience.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
But what makes a thought start?
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
I take no gifts from you.
You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
I've drunk enough tonight.
Now that is very interesting --  Take a chair, Joseph,
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
Any attacks of pain since?
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
She would if she could.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
Where are they? Last chance.
Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
Yeah. I sure will.
Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator?  All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
He didn't kill her.
You killed that cop Dutton.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
I don't want to see!
My father.
You know.
Look, can I just call a cab?
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Watch out!
It still doesn't mean...
About them. You've got to leave it alone.
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
No -- not at all.
Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
Professor Barnhardt.
What do you mean, dear?
Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
You're just kidding, aren't you?
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Mr. Brady's a cop.
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
The present situation?
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
What about him?
How do you know?
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
Jittery is the word.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
Yes--?
Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
Where is the meeting going to be?
He'll have you -- and Tom.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
Well, how do I know who you are?
They would have killed this man?
This one could save your life.
You're eating maggots.  How do they taste?
Yeah.
No.  Stick around.
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you?  Well, you don't know shit, buddy.
Chill out Edgar.
The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
Sam, don't --
I told Max eight o'clock.
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
I thought we were goin' into town.
I hate goin' into town.  That's about as close to town as I like to get.
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
I like Michael.
He's just a deep sleeper.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
I'll hitch.
I'll pass.
Grandpa has plans of his own.  Michael, I want you to do this. Everybody has been bending over backwards for you.  You come home late.  You sleep in to the middle of the day -- Sam is always alone. You do exactly what you want... tonight do what I want for a change.
Not that poor.
He's already gone to bed.
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
I hear this is the decade for cute.
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
I hope so.
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
Well... what do I know?  I'm a bachelor.  Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you.
What?!  Did you know that!?
What do you mean?
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
No.  Why?
No.  On the phone.
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Huh?...
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
What's it going to do, being a plant?
You lying bastard...
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
We got morphine, don't we.
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
Then I'll have to kill you.
All in Norwegian.
I guess I'm the only one.
Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
You reach anybody yet?
Damn if I won't.
If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks...
Just keep looking.
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
Calm down and get in your position.
Bet the last place you ever go.
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
What for?
MacReady, that you?
He's one of them.
What happened?
No...
1899.
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
It frightens you.
Yes...
Do you know which way?
Why did they built it?
Vox...
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
I don't understand.
No, we created the Morlocks.
As slaves.
As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
They survived above.  Became what they are.
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
It can't all be like this...
Why would you let me go back?
No...
I don't think that's going to happen.
And why not?
I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden --
Admiration?  My my.
Trust me...
Darling.
Tonight's the night?
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
I live with it every minute of every day.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
Sir...?
I don't understand.
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
You can see so many here.
We all have that dream.
Thank you.
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
Or mud carriers.
I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done.  I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.
You liked it there.
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
So you can use it now?
Go back to your own time?
I could...
No, sir --
We have to go after them, find where -- !
They've gone to a better place.
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
That's quite enough, Kalen.
No, you're safe --
Kalen, look at me.  There's no one here but us.  You see... I'm here, you're here, Alexander's here. There are no Morlocks.  It was just a dream...
I'm fine.
But... what about Starks?
It's not my job to believe you.
Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious?
Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is.
[Pointedly] Of course you're not.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
My business?
How...how are you here?
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
I thought you said you never knew your father.
I don't know what you're talking about, man. I swear. This is some weird shit you're telling me... and I don't know how come you're doing it.
They should just be looking harder.
Good.
[Beat] Thank you.
Jackie, get in the car. NOW!
[Beat] What's your name?
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
Well, you belong in one.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
[Beat] What?
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
Please...
After I...
What?
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
You think Lorenson kills you?
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
You're not crazy.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
My dad wrote some things down before he died.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
Yeah.
What for?
Good.
Is it true?
Becker does? Are you sure?
[Beat] Thanks.
I'm not sure.
Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
Sure.
Have you always been a waitress?
What?!
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
Yes, baby?
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
I gotta go to Little Rock.
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
That's certainly possible.
I have no problem with that.
Just some young guy.  Around twenty years old.  Dark hair.
I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
Oh, great.
You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.
What's wrong?
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
That sounds nice.
You're a bank robber?
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Fishing.  Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me.  This is serious.  I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.  Can you do that?
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
Who is it?
It's me.
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Get the car.
West.  Left.
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
So this is all my fault, is it.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Give me the keys.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Will I be?
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
She thinks he's a pig.
I won't wait up.
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
What.
Now what what?
You mean now or before?
Before.
What little dogs?
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Gosh.  It sure is.
Just ignore him.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
Suck my dick... Boom!!
Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please...
I believe you.
Just asking.
You do?
What do you mean?
It'd have to be pretty good.
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
How long do you think that'll take?
Say you're sorry.
Fuck you.
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Loser? You?
Well once. Mary.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
You're kidding? What did they say?
I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing.
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
Well... at least now you know.
Never met him.
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
I am?
Got cash.
Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.
I'm usually too tired to be.
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
A girl after your own heart, Ted.
Huh. I guess I just wish they made them like they used to. You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid... or Harold and Maude.
I guess.
Uh-huh.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
You can't be serious.
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
So you found Mary?
So she hasn't changed?
No, not at all.
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Your turn?
That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more -- it was my turn. It was time for me... time for me... to be happy.
You mean him.
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
I never said that.
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
Oh. Well I am.
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name... Steverino? You could've at least passed the baton on that one.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
Where's Puffy?
Oh Jesus...
Just a minute.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Oh... are you... ?
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
You look great.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
Shhhhhh!
What?! No please, sir --
She's a dental hygienist. She'll know what to do.
I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.
No, that's really unneces --
What do you mean?
Oh God.
Eh.
I'm gonna take a rain check.
McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
Kenny. It's over.
Yes it is.
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
I see.
Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set.
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
That's right. What are you doing here? This is a religious ceremony you're desecrating.
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit.
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
I got one up on ya.
I've got the doer. I know who he is.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!
Let the press through.
Let's go.
And...
Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
What are you talking about?
You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Yeah. Fitful dreams.
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
I read, Cooch.
No. No, no. Thank you.
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
Washington sent ya. I know that.
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
And on to a bigger one with you?
It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
Where were you?
On his six.
I was inverted.
What would?
For what?
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
I'm different.
I'm starting to sense that now.
Make what?
You're an animal.
That's true. What are you?
. Yeah!
I'm fine.
That's what you get flight pay for.
It does.
Everything passes. Immutable law of the Universe.
The big one. The one that's most on your mind.
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
And that's one!
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
I live here, remember?
Yes sir!
No sir! But you have to be ready.
Yes sir!
These guys are getting on my nerves.
Saving them some paperwork.
Not anymore.
BREAKING LEFT!
Is it the plane?
Got you here.
This is Maverick.
Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
Gotta keep track of the competition.
Look, Ma, top of the world!
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Nothing. Let's just go fight.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the...
I can't eject.
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
Come on. I died enough for one night.
They should have warned you about that one.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
What'd you do?
Don't.
Was.
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
No. You can be mine!
Tell me one thing.
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
So have I.
Helping him in.
Didn't everybody?
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
I like that in a fighter pilot.  It's okay to be confident. You have to think you're King Kong to want to try to land on carriers. Just keep in mind the other component of success...teamwork.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
Yes sir.
The flying. The fighting.  I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good.  Just give me the jet.
All right.
I know.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Who is it this time--my mother?
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
Yes, sir.
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
At Rekall.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
Watch your mouth, Captain.
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Unh-uh, pal.  You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
Lori, move.
Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.
Some men just tried to kill me!
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
Doug...
Implanted.
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
Good to see ya. Right this way.
How real does it seem?
Let me go!
You couldn't get me a message?  You never wondered what happened to me?
There's something I have to tell you...
Why would I lie to you?
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
I saw them.
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
I'm leaving it here.  Come get it and keep moving.
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Cannon fuse.
Just barely, Pham.  What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on?  Come back.
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
Well, I was wondering if we could...
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
Me, too.
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Its tires are flat...
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
Like hell you are.
The con...!  Oh my God.
I didn't do it!  What's going on?
Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
LET'S DO IT!
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
I noticed.
Yeah, well I had reasonable cause to believe the judge might've heard of the Fourth Amendment.
Not necessarily...
How can you remember that?
Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?
Not at all --
I specialize, Roger...
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
-- Remember?
Eddie... I don't know about this...
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
-- You found his mugshot?
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
Want to tell me what went down here?
I killed the motherfucker.
Well I know that you're innocent, Shu -- even if you forgot.
Jimmy Chin? Was that self-defense too?
See-cil.
See-cil. I'm Eddie Dowd, this is Roger Baron. We're lawyers.
Thank you, Mr. Stipe.
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
-- alleged crime --
No? Then what did he say?
-- What trial?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
And why was an exception made?
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
Don't be late.
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
Anything else?
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
He didn't suffer.
No.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
I see. He does talk loud.
It must be a high priority situation.
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
Yes, he is like a clown.
Oh god, Laura.
Donna, are you my best friend?
Nothing.
Jacques, help me get her home. NOW!
What can I tell you?
WE got it back, that's all.
I can't help you there.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
Yep...  Yes...  It is.
What does Bob say?
Oh, yes... yes...
I am The Muffin.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
James...
No.
Eating?
You'd think so.
They were looking for wood.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
Fish eyes?
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
That's right.
Nothing, I chickened out.
Norma, are you alright?
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
I'm fine.
Yes.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
We thought it was just.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
You've just said you signed it.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
I know of him.
What book is that?
I'm on the staff of...
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
...We did everything we could...
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Well...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
The most respected...
I understand.
How old is he?
Mrs...
That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop?
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Why is that?
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.  I myself would take it and run like a thief.
I'm sure you would.
Ready, your Honor.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Noted. Thank you.  Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed...
Still looking.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
And are they going to get it?
That's what I'm going to try to do.
What...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Yes.
Well, then what are you doing here?
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
You, you don't under...
What are you going to do?
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
Kathy Price.
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
He's not in, Sir.
He's... you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.  He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
Yeah.
That's right.
I think we tried that. The case is over.
Yeah. I'm awake.
We got to talk.
In New York?
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
Me, too.
Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses.  They'll be stopped -- somehow!
What was it like?
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
Maybe ...  Maybe they want to take us alive.
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
Have you got a pocket compass?
If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one.
I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
So I don't know about horror.
Come on.  Kids love horror.
Heather, has there been another call?
Diabetes?
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
What?
Can you come with me in my dreams?
A story?
When do you think it'll be done?
Seemed, not was.
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
'S okay.
What's that?
Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
He knows.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.
You're not a moron.
Wanna bet?  Takes me half a day to get through one chapter of Lawford and I still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about.  You know why it takes me so long to write papers?  because I can't spell.  While everybody else is sleeping, I'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary.
What about you?
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
I gotta go.
We all have problems.
Maybe it's an air raid.
I can't watch this.
Good.
I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
How do you know?  They might.
'Cause they're getting a divorce.  That's why they sent me here.  My sister's at Tabor.  They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
I couldn't.
Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
Of what?
So is violating international law.
Twice.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
Why are you here?
A padlock.
That's enough.
Shut up donut.
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
I don't have to listen to this.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
It seems we're short on singers.
No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
About yourself?
No.
I'm not staying out here.
What makes you so sure it was one?
I don't think one second of this is funny, sir.
No.  I didn't.
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
Why? He's right in the groove.
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
That'd be fine, Bobby.
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
Ready for another?
Feed store keeps up to five K in their safe. Need me a good boy for back-up. Even split. You interested?
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass?
No shit?!?! You know him?
What's the name of it?
Thanks.
Sailor... Lula loves you.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
What?
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
You won't of missed much.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
Dell disappeared. Dell was learnin' a hard lesson. What I learned from observin' Dell is I think people who are frightened want to disappear. He'd startin' behavin' weird? Like comin' up to people every fifteen minutes and askin' how they were doin'?
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
Yeah, maybe...
Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this, sweetie. Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me...
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
We oughta stay somewhere outta the way. Not in no Holidays or Ramadas or Motel Six. If Johnnie Farragut's on our trail he'll check those first.
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
What's that, peanut?
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
What was this one?
It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
I'm goin'.
Yeah.
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
You knew my daddy?
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
Yeah, I'm here.
Don't know, but she's gonna bleed all over our car, I'll tell ya that...  Hey... Hello... Girl... You gotta come with us, honey.
Fan works.
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
That was in Vietnam.
What?
Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
The Indian official who supplied this information did so only on condition of anonymity. The Uttar Pradesh state authorities last October released five hundred turtles...
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
Six.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Yes.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
Santos...
Explain it... I told you.
Where?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Through the forehead?
One day he's gonna find out what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble.
Well?...
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
Mm.
I just mean...
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
He finished it Winter Break.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Because... because...
Shit.
James? My James? What's happened?
Kidnapped? By who?
His parents.
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
Evidently.  Coming!
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
It's mine.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
She told you about...
Actually, it was her husband's dog...
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
Heaven?
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
What are we going to do with...
Whose tuba is that anyway?
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
The guy on the phone.
Yes.
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Hm.
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
How can you tell?
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
Because of my coat?
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.
I thank you.
Do?
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
Jesus.
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
That good, huh?
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
About the baby.
I know, but sometimes...
Tony. Now that I'm home.
He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
Give me a break, Grady.
Horses, right. Vernon something...  Hardapple.
The perpetrator.
No, I'm going ho --
Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel room.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
Five years.
You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood.
Annette? She's good... tense.
This little table is one heavy bitch.
You need a table.
Then what? What?!
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
I know, man. I love this table too.  But I also love my wife.
Next week? The week after?
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
I don't like starlings.
How does it sound?
I bet you can.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Do you come here often?
It's good to listen to your daddy.
Not yet.
It means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.
I would.
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
No.
What?
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
I count my blessings.
And your new apartment?
It gives me headaches.
But you are taking it?
No you're not.
Yes you can, Robin.
I know because... it's just something I know.
Yes?
I said the job is okay.
Why not?
You think reflection is good.
Forget it.
I'm not that crazy.
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
That is a marvelous image, Walter. Because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around.
We have a few more minutes.
We have a lot of work to do.
Is this the first one?
You mean my problem?
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
That's my answer.
Why?
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
How do you feel about that?
Neither do you.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
You should buy several. I've got shitty light in my place, but my plants don't seem to mind. Light's important, but it's not everything.
I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two.
Yeah?
Maybe later.
Is that all?
Because I like you.
Yeah.
It's not what you think.
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
You really believe that?
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
I love my brothers.
Not ever?
Neither am I.
I've got problems.
Who doesn't?
Piece of cake, baby.
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
Your rig?
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
No.
Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
But what did he see that made him panic?
Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
They'll come out after us.
What's the plan?
It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.
All right.  Do it!
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
Wilhite, anything?
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.
How deep?
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
What! After giving us such a run around...
And have you any other truths to tell me?
I understand very well. Only I don't want any rash assumptions to be made.
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
Have you decided?
And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.
Yes, maybe that is better.
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
Better dead.
It was futile. We went all over.
Would you please see if Sandro is with him? He's not in his room. I'm sorry to disturb you.
It couldn't be any clearer.
What do you think?
I think it's possible.
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Ask her.
Here I am.
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
Well...probably at the last stop, which is Noto.
I don't see why I should mind.
Yes, we will.
Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is...
Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so impatient?
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
He talked to you Himself?
She'd punish me.
Because...
It's a sin to be fat.
Agnes...
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
Of God.
What would you like to talk about.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Yes.
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
Would you like to talk about it?
No. I was sick.
Down... there.
In the middle of all the pain?
I... I don't understand.
Agnes...
Anything.
Somebody told her.
I don't know.
You'll laugh.
Do you?
Because I don't want one.
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
Like you?
A mistake... it was a mistake...
I was a mistake.
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
She tells you you're ugly?
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Oh, yes.
You're a mistake.
I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
And why am I here?
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
No.
She made me promise not to.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
Someone's following me.
A crucifix.
No.
Are you ill?
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Yes.
Agnes, who did this to you?
H... how?
I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.
???
Sister...
Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
You have proof?
I'll have it.
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
None as far as I know.
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
What's your opinion?
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
It's possible isn't it?
I was appalled, just as you are now.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
Not simple, no.
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
How?
Nothing.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
The sheets...
Sister Paul?
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
Listening to angels?
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
The woman's health is at stake.
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Hand rolled.
Even Christ would partake socially.
And Saint John would chew tobacco.
Become?  One is born a saint.
Would it stop you if I did?
Of course.
Then let's begin.
For Agnes.
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
Somebody told her.
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
Where is she?
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Too late for what?
That's a lie.
Wasn't it!
The usual ten per cent?
The cards... you're bank.
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Nine.
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Yeah?
How about Ding Dong?
I'll murder that Lennon.
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
Ah well. Eh, look!
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
Is he?
He comes from a large family.
Follow your impulse.
How'd you guess?
I'm not ...
Oh aye, a sledge.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
And what do you do about it?
You can learn from books.
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
I'm not wrong.
Have they?
Oh, they seem all right to me.
Lip reading.
Eh?
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
Every morning.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
I think you're soft or something.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Like what?
No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
You are.
And my nose...
Oh, leave off!!!
He'll get over it.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
No, we're not!
It's not my fault.
Down the ... er ...
Get knotted!
A proper Aborigine.
Yeah, it's you all right.
Hell, we're equipped --
No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
Where the hell are we?
That's what I'm going to do.
Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
Then take her down.
But functioning.
What's up?
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
God I'm hungry.
Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
Shit...
We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
I hope not.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
How does he breathe?
Good.
Don't be an idiot.
Sounds like a rough one.
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
Oh... God...
Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
Dell -- show me that on a screen.
You lead.
What is it?
The commander normally has first publication rights.
We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
Could be some kind of venom, or poison...
Right.  Fire up all systems.
Engine room, what happened?
Any microorganisms?
Good.  I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open.
It appears to be some sort of spacecraft.  We're going to approach it.
They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
We're coming!
Now what?
That'll blow the ship up.
Yeah... I forgot.
No... don't...
Sure.
Better tell the boss.
Shit.  When?
Force the door.
Nooooo!
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
That's a fact.
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
What?
What's wrong?
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Which mean physically going outside.
Compensate!
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Check out the tent.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
Don't wait for me!
Please do.
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
All paved with diamonds and gold?
Paved with what, then?
I didn't mean just the Theater.
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
But the $500 you got to get out of town brought you straight to New York - didn't it?
Yes, Addison.
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
Why not?
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities...
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
Of course I knew.
Just slipped your mind.
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Bill-
Huh?
This is Eve Harrington.
Like a nylon lemon peel-
Byron couldn't have said it more graciously... here we go-
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
Then you're crazy.
I get a party, don't I?
To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
I thought you were going to be late-
So she seems.
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?
Don't calm down.
I've been aware of that for some time.
Margo, let's make peace.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
It's not nonsense.
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
I understand she is now the understudy in there.
With the paper to prove it.
Are you proud of me, Bill?
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
No thanks, Birdie.
But she just got here...
Of course!
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
Just because you can't even work a zipper. It was very thoughtful, Eve, and I appreciate it-
Why not?
I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
Probably not.
Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck, Susan Hayward - of course, they're just movie stars.
Oh, no. I see the play.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
My husband...
Well...
Hollywood.
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
You've really got a low opinion of me, haven't you? We'll I'll give you some pleasant news. I've been told off in no uncertain terms all over town. Miss Channing should be happy to hear that. To know how loyal her friends are - how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be...
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
But the raves about your performance-
Over my dead body...
Farmers were poor in those days, that's what dad was - a farmer. I had to help out. So I quit school and I went to Milwaukee. I became a secretary. In a brewery.  When you're a secretary in a brewery - it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else. Everything is beer. It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home -  and there was a Little Theater Group... like a drop of rain in the desert. That's where I met Eddie. He was a radio technician. We played 'Liliom' for three performances, I was awful - then the war came, and we got married. Eddie was in the air force - and they sent him to the South Pacific. You were with the O.W.I., weren't you Mr. Richards?  That's what 'Who's Who' says... well, with Eddie gone, my life went back to beer. Except for a letter a week. One week Eddie wrote he had a leave coming up. I'd saved my money and vacation time. I went to San Francisco to meet him.  Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee - the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all. That Eddie was dead...  ... so I figured I'd stay in San Francisco. i was alone, but couldn't go back without Eddie. I found a job. And his insurance helped... and there were theaters in San Francisco. And one night Margo Channing came to play in 'Remembrance'... and I went to see it. And - well - here I am...
Of course it is.
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
Right here.
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
She's just outside the door.
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
Please don't play governess, Karen, I haven't your unyielding good taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter...  I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR should I say "ain't I"?
Not many car either, not much chance of a lift...
You're Margo. Just - Margo.
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that, you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...  ... slow curtain. The end.
In a minute...
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
If we could cast it properly, that is...
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
You - for one. I told her you were set on Margo playing the part - and I certainly wouldn't make a change without your approval.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
Don't be evasive.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all-  - Max you sly puss.
She was a revelation...
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
I don't think I could be.
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
When's the audition?
I promise.
--it was fine the way it was--
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
--a spy, you mean?
It makes sense; Hunt worked for the C.I.A. and the White House was paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.
Were you eyebrow reading?
Nothing--I just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am.  I never like it when the other guy's human...
--we gotta top the Times--
--shit, who do we know?--
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
We're inside the White House now.
Who?
What's the matter?
--and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
Night.
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
--that was awhile ago--
--"I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Toronto." That was your spiel then. "The Lifestyles of Deserters."  I'm still waiting for it.
We've just been talking to Young--
And?--
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
Who by?
Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth.
I'm not your source on that.
My non-denial denial.
How senior?
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
Talk? Once, at a gathering, he put his hand over a candle. And he kept it there. He kept it right in the flame until his flesh seared. A woman who was watching asked, "What's the trick?" And he replied. "The trick is not minding."
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Where?
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
But it's possible.
I really want to know.
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
Hunt is Colson's man--  --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to Brown University--  --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
--go over your sources again--
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
Of course--everything they asked--
You're a killer, Ozzy!
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
Uh-huh.
You're gonna shit your pants!
Okay.  I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
You can call me Ostreicher.
I'm glad you think so.
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
You talked to Stifler?
That's nice.
Onions?
You can't sing at the competition.
Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  So I guess...I'll see you later.
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
I'll save you a seat.
Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
Nothing!
Dad, come in.
These are for you.  From father to son.
Yes.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
I know.
I thought so.
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
God dammit, Stifler!
Check-out time!  Please vacate the room.
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
But you don't love me.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Yeah.
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
That junior chick?
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Also like sex with my wife.
Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand... that's it...
You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
Uh-huh. Good for you.
And who's Claude?
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
A la votre.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
I don't know...
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
Shit!
Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did.  Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who -
You'll never get the chance.
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
I told you. These murders are not normal.
Allo?
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
He says -
Merde.
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
I'm not sure but look. . .
Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean.
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
You are the Princess.
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which	is natural ... Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never	grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute ...
Bartok... a question.
Ah! Let us begin!
Run, Anya -  go...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
Please, if you'd just listen...
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
I need a large polo mallet!
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
No, Chippewa Falls.
Okay.
Huh?
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
And I love what you're wearin'.
Yeah, I know.
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
No, I got time.
Oh, sorry.
Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Oh, I see, I see.
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
Okay?
Okay. Yeah.
Oh.
As Balzac said...
"There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.
H'm?
big subject with me, yeah.
M'hm.
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Mine.
Let's just do it, all right?
Yeah.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
What?
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
Yeah, where is the spider?
snow shovel or anything or something.
Yeah.
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
Alvy, come on, for your own experience. I mean, you wanna write, why not?
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
Oh!
Can I confess something?
Why are you so hostile?
What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
I can't.
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
You have a raccoon?
Who said that?
Key word here is "indulgent."
What are you depressed about?
It's a narrow view.
Oh, do yuh?
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
Mean?
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Ah.
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
We can show her the schoolyard.
While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.
Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs.
Well, sit down.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
Di-diabetes? Is that any excuse? Diabetes?
She's a colored woman, from Harlem!
You think so? Do you really?
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
Hey-
It was a wonderful set.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was a great beauty.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Oh yes.
It's the way they do things.
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
Who, Sally?
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
Well, probably.
Oh.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
Don't you miss it?
Yeah.
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
I never put myself in harm's way.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
Just did.  Jealous?
I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag.  You just need to get into a car and go.
Nice to meet you.
Oh yeah...
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
Probably not.
Fantastic.  Out here.
You only made half your quote this year.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Whatever you say.
Did he promise?
Scout's honor.
Not.
It's ecstasy, Sal.
She left the fucking gate open.
He'll find his way back.
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Don't.
Okay.
Me too.
He's my favorite.
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
You're an interior decorator, right?
Sally did all this herself?
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm a total fucking maniac.  Delete all that, okay?  I spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife.  Oh shit.  I get pissy sometimes. Much worse than Otis.  Otis doesn't bite. It's just, I really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. We live in a canyon.  We hear dogs barking at night, too.  And it's not Otis.
I'm a little in the puke zone.
What am I, five?
Lemon it is.
I like you.
You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
Time!
I think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan.  But I think you're really nice people...
I don't need a drug.
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
God willing.
Yes.
Not at all.
Do you need anything else?
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
Would you, like, marry him?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Okay.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
You're a shit.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
What are they?
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
Nevermind.
So where should I put it?
Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
No you are not.  You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  "Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..." English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
No -- an <u>individual</u>!
Right...because every ant's important!
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
Look around, sweetheart.
Wait, I hear something!
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
I...I have no idea, sir.
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
...Ants...
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
Yeah, I know.
Ma'am?
What did I tell you?
It's a bet.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Sure.
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
How come?
Eight-thirty!
Cheers.
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
No -- it's my stomach.
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
Sure.
You don't have to entertain me.
I don't want it.
Pick a card.
What for?
Do I have to?
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
For me?
No -- just come as you are.
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
That's very wise.
Of course not.
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Who?
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
No I didn't.
Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
You?
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
Kubelik -- with two k's.
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
I took sleeping pills.
No.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
I don't believe you.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
That's enough, Fran.
You're not being funny.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
The nerve.
What gives?
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
See if they'll what?
What !
No -- absolutely not --
Delta ?
North ?
What unit were you with ?
Fat. That's real fat.
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
The draft of that river might be too shallow on the point.
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
Too far inland.
He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
Whose orders ?
Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
Yeah, it still runs.
Nobody comes in here.
No, it'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back.
Yeah.
Okay, Willard, sit down.
This gentleman or myself ?
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
I always thought the French came here to get the rubber.
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
When did you hear?
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
I'm Kurtz.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
Yes.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
Yeah, I like it...
You can't have water after morphine.
I think think a lie stinks.
What are you doing?
I had immense plans.
The Yater -- the clear one with the thin stringer.
When?
Sure.
Captain Willard -- we got these from Nha Thrang two days ago -- they expected you here then --
Why?
Why didn't he shoot you?
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
I should be checking on the boat.
What's a big question?
What did you hear?
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
How did she..?
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
No way can he get away with this. I'll be back by tonight.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
That's not what I meant.
Not me.  I'm equipped.
That's my line.
I'll tell you everything later.
Where's Corbett?
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
My home is here.  With you.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Leave my traps.  We'll tag up, couple days.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
I already have.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
I'm right fuckin' here with you.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Since forever.
I've got Jews at my table.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
What's with the dark?
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
My son is sick, okay?
Yes.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
I can't. I work.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
No.
Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
Okay.
One baked -- one fries.
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
What are you doing here?
What a nice compliment.
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
How to die, mostly.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
Hey -- you called me... I...
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Last word freak.
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Please, just leave.
No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
Melvin...
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
Because...  ... you love her?
Did you like it that much?
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to know my name.
How long have you been freelance?
Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a fucking genius.  They said he shaded you over and over.  And in the end, he aced you again.  Shaded and faded.  They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit.  I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right?
It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
Know what?
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
Why?
Yes.
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
Good.
You were there?
Yes.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
Not even a stalemate?
That sounds nice.
Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
Sorry.
How was the beach?
No.  It would be amateur.  A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
Ten years ago.
What happened?
What did he want?
They're worth less points.
No?
And you were drilling these holes...?
Yes.
Why?
She was taken.
No.
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
That doesn't sound normal.
I'm not normal.
All the time.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
Yeah.
How would you like the funds?
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
Never heard of K-MART?
Yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints!
Fifteen crowns.
We could make a run for it?
Too right....Now the other thing we've got to do is start clearing up the rubble. Can you make a start on that?
So?
I thought that was part of the charm!
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Good, I love swinging a shovel.
No....The Asylum!
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
No, it's welded up!....Let's take a look from the inside.
But how did the wall get here?
Don't we have enough already?
You'd be better off with tables and chairs.
Destroy the evidence huh.
Have you ever stolen anything?
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
Well, I think I_ve got a handle on the Czech pysche and I reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties. Plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for Kafka.
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
Both, see you later.
What?
It just happened.
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
What do you want me to do?
No!
No, by road?
Yeah!
Turn around quick!
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
No!
Here's the details.
Whatever!
Let's have a look anyway.
Yeah, you're right.... I've got an idea!
But we could go to London and live in England.
There's nothing there for me.
Sure, I've done it easily.
Don't worry. Thanks.
It's perfect, you've done a great job.
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
I had it coming from someone.
Are you sure I shouldn't get a doctor.
Yeah, but it was okay.
You will wish you hadn't.
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
Don't you dare, I'll be back!
You are quite sure it's secure?
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
-- I like the car I have.
That's over. Way over.
You're fine like that, Mom.
Thanks.
Me neither.
I meant he's a doctor.
That'd be something.
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
-- This your idea of small talk?
-- Obviously.
You don't know me.
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
I don't want to have any conversation.
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
Go for it.
It's like a to-do list, but for my life.
You want to tell me...
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
Do you think I'm strange?
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
The dirty snowball at its core.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
Yeah --
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Where?
That. And less strange.
Twice a year.
The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
Mars doesn't rise until 2:30
What about your father?
I don't care.
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
That I want you to take me home.
Tired.
He wants help with his lines --
Yes, sir.
Ever again.
Jamie wanted that. She told me.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Yeah.
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
Seventeen.
Yeah. Maybe so.
No!
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
Why?
Mr. McFly here wants to nuke it all, just so he can see it!
All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
Pro! Release the rope!
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
Don't you understand? The mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events, and changing history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear.
Sure, he agreed quickly.
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
No way!
Hi, Marty!
Gone?... Where?
Okay.
Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
Tom...
I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one around.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
Doing what?
He'll say that?
Yeah.
Nothing.
Quit my job.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
I got him in the stomach.
Yeah.
How about over here?
Yeah.
I just don't want to go.
Who're you?
Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Let her out?  She's a killer.
New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...
How did she die?  I wanna know.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
Believe in Penny Priddy?
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
Damn John Whorfin--!
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Better than him.
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
How about you? Will you be alright?
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
What. What don't I understand?
Barton!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
Stop it, Bill!
He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, really... He... He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures.
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
Then who should I talk to?
Well I...
He's a great writer –
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going – don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Charlie. How are you.
Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet – what happened to your ear?
Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor – though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong – Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
Defense against what? Insurance? Something they need? Something they should be thanking me for offering? A little peace of mind?...
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
Why don't we go to your room-
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
Mr. Lipnik.
Anyway, I had Lou read your script for me.
Okay then, everything seems to be in order. Everything seems to be in order.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
How's about it, Bart?
Excellent picture.
We got a treatment on it yet?
Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element. And a romantic interest. You know the drill.  Romantic interest, or else a young kid. An orphan. What do you think, Lou? Wally a little too old for a romantic interest?  Look at me, a writer in the room and I'm askin' Lou what the goddamn story should be!
Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas". These are big movies, Fink. About big men, in tights – both physically and mentally. But especially physically. We don't put Wallace Beery in some fruity movie about suffering – I thought we were together on that.
Thank you.
Yeah.
She said what you said she'd say.
Why didn't you tell me?
Nilsen.
Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
Tell me about Catherine.
What did she tell me, Beth?
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
Didn't you study it in school?
What if I call you Nicky?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
Did you?  What's she doing?
Somebody has to die.
Yes I am.
It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
What kind of talk?
I hope I helped you out.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just hide it.
What are you doing here, Pop?
Somethin', though.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
I know what that's like.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
Yeah.  I know.
Is he dead?
We bring her in for questioning.
And you volunteered.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
She killed him.
It was an accident.
It's yours.
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Ignorant art?
Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
I need a dealer.
I'm here.
Yes, I understand – but where do you take them from?
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
I'm not black.
You're not?
Not what?
See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
Out?
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve – I mean Shenge.
Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, Benny.  "Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me." I did say chicken!
Oh – you mean black people!
Hi Gina.
'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
You don't have any fucking money..
It's Monday morning.
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
Don't you think he's using you?
Forget it.
I'll take it.  Andy, gimme three thousand dollars.  Just the caviar – I'll get the rest.
Hi.
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
Jean Michel Basquiat.
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
So shut up and keep painting..
What time is it?
A what?
Yeah.
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
Alright, thanks.
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
...four, five.
What're you really after?
Things change.
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Oh.  "Kyle."
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
"We"?  You and...
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
You first.
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
Your blood, Max.
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.
Why, yes, actually.  Death and chance stole your parents.  But rather than become a victim, you have done everything in your power to control the fates.  For what is Batman if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world, an attempt to control death itself.
No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
What seems to be the problem?
Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.
Oxbridge Academy?
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
He'll be here.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
What are you talking about?
Dr. Pamela Isley.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
Maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your attentions.  So back off or I'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment.  Got me?
<		Maybe it's something in the water.
I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
She wants to kill you.
You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
You lie!
At you?  Polly want a kiss?
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
What do you mean?
Love you?  I loathe your bipedal arrogance, your animal superiority. My only joy is knowing that even now my poison kiss is sucking the life from your ape-like face.
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
She has an excellent mind.
No. You said I. I killed them.
_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
...A bat.
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
Exactly!
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
We'll talk some other -
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
What?
What?
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
I don't-.
So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
Miss.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
I won't let you have it.
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
Better. It's not on the market yet.
So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most.
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
As far as I know.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
Mm-hmm.  Lunch.  Not even dinner.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
Hang on. I have to leave a message.
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
WHAT??
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
Is that what you "heard"?
I've considered that possibility.
Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
His face.  Allie, look at his face.
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
You okay?
Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.
I said I'd check with you.
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
One.
David, I'm serious!
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
Yes.  Great.  Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
I can understand THAT. Neither do I.
She's ... well, she's good.
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
Exactly.  She's in a surprisingly terrible state.  Isn't she, Bean?
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
Certainly is.
Sure.  You're right.
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
Great, good.
Yes?
You know the thing I hate most about children?
Nope.
Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Huh huh. We're gonna score now.
Cool! Huh huh huh.
My butt's bothering me!
Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
Whoa, this is cool! Heh heh. It's like, everything looks all weird and...
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Dill-wad...
Butt-snatch...
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya?  Damn, she's goin' all the way!
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
I see it. I don't get it.
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Cut the power!
It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Almost.
God... Manchurian Tung oil? There's enough to refinish the gateleg table <u>and</u> the cherry wardrobe!
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
That's my girl!
Death didn't improve your sense of humor.
Where are your skulls and bones?
Three times.  Powerful number.
No, we don't.  We can work something out ourselves.  We just have to try harder.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
Just a hunch.
We're ghosts.
You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you?  My father bought this place.  He never walks away from equity.  Why don't <u>you</u> leave?
W... We didn't know how to make one.
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
Start simply.  Do what you know. Use your talents.  Practice.  We only help those who help themselves. Just do a little at a time.  And of course, practice, practice, practice.  It's tricky but -- you weren't murderers by any chance, were you?
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
No.  You don't want his help.
You people have really screwed up!  I received word that you allowed yourselves to be <u>photographed</u>.  And you let Betelgeuse out and didn't put him back, and you let Otho get ahold of the handbook.
You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
We're practicing.
No, wait!
No, Lydia, we're dead.
That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
Where'd they go?
Of course you do.
He's your cousin.
We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.
Lydia.  What the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax?  Go help your mother.
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
Otho, can you do it?
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
Tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids. Kids!  I love them.
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
An attorney?
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
Yes, I will.
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
Yes. I lost my remote control.
... Mentor...?
So am I, Eve.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older...
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover.  Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
... I see.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
I agree.
And I'm Ben.
And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you must excuse me - I'm very tired all of a sudden.
Yes. I would like to do that.
I like to watch.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
... Oh.
It's very sore.
... Good evening, Louise.
I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white.
I'm going to work in the garden.
Yes. That is surprising.
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
How were you paid?
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
No, I don't think so. And I have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers.
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
I have no claim, Thomas.
Yes, I will.
Yes. I will.
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Try again.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
... Yeah...
Well... He's either very, very bright or very, very dense - he's hard to figure...  ... Let's just keep everything legal.
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
No, sir.
So...? Where the hell is it?
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
I would appreciate that.
Yes, I did.
It's that serious, huh?
Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
Take care of yourself, Ben.
Yeah.
Who am I thinking of?
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right.
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
No they're not.
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
Holy shit! He said what I said!
That... was... no... simulation.
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Schwartz.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
I said "yes."
You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you’re implying.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
Who told you?
The usual, Barry.
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
It better be.
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
My God.
I've fallen in love.
Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
A scary dream?
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
The Great Mantini?
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Fine. Let's drop it.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Forget it.
Do you?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
Oh, sorry. Right this way.
I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs.  Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
Let her go, Craig. I mean “him."
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
When?
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
Yes, Maxine, yes.
What the fuck is going on?
No one would ever have to know its not him.
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
Know it, and go on out the yard. Go on.
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
Those boys didn't even know him. You had six whole years of marriage to my Halle Fathered every one of your children. A blessing. I learned hard that a man's just a man, but a son like that...like Halle..now that's somebody.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YES.
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.
You on your way home?
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
I don't. I have my own.
Well, good luck with the job.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
In case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad I can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. Anything.  Don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
Mama?
Better ask Paul D.
Can't locate him.
He ask, I give him anything.
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
You was friends.
Ella.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
I run him off.
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
She was only-
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now.
Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted.  I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
What do you think?
Well Dude, we just don't know.
Uh-huh.
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
The?  Who the fff--
The Gundersons.  It's a wandering daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man. Her real name is Fawn Gunderson. Her parents want her back.
Well maybe you and me could pool our resources--trade information-- professional courtesy--compeers, you know--
Come and get it.
That is our most modestly priced receptacle.
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
Walter, how--
So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--
That fucking bitch!
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
I'm shomer shabbas.
What's that, Walter?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- Arthur Digby Sellers.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Lebowski on the right?
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
Are these.
Different mothers, huh?
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
Mm.
Yeah.  Thanks man.
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!
Huh?
Yeah man.
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
He fixes the cable?
Now I got--
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
Well yeah...I know that.
Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
Huh?
Hey man--
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
Calmer than you are.
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
Easy, Dude.
What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's the bridge--
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
Now Dude--
Yeah.
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
And the fucking money!
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!
Huh?
We're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.
Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping blood.  Might pass out.
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS!
Who is this?
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
Stay away from me, mister!
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
We're going to be working as a unit, you people will be taking orders from me.  So let's get it over with.  I'll give you a free shot, Reinhardt.
Exactly.  Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified.  Super charged.  And this --
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
Not good.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
Then who does he work for?
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
Maybe it's better that way.
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Nope.  Back then we did not.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you, though?
Wait.
You're wrong.
Watch me.
It's because I'm human that I can do this.
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
He didn't. Get over it.
Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
You don't look so good.
No --
You don't have to be.
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
But you use blood banks --
--which she may have--
Join the club.
Closer.
Bullshit! Talk!
Something was wrong.
--whatever; that's her.
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
We've looked at half of one tape.
What?
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
I see for proof positive you're the goddamn witch--
Beta Cam's still coming back tomorrow, right?
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
Both. Now.
No.
--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
No fucking.
Don't have one.
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
--shhhh! #5, there's something up there!
What?
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
--it's less than four feet, just--
No. I don't think so.
And what's your excuse for being here?
Okay.
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
Get some more beer.
She's off her fucking rocker--
Heather.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
I thought all witches were benign and good.
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in?
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...
Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much.
Abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him. And when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead...
No.
Sign.
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
Yeah.
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
Yeah? Well how irritated are you?
Jesus, I don't believe it...
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Meurice...
Tuesday night is ladies' night. All your drinks are free.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Why do you do it?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Alright, suit yourself.
Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see. I'll get you.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Shit. You better tell me something.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
Well.
THEN WHAT?
Then you got undressed.
See my breasts?  . See?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Don't say that.
Who's it, you mean.
No.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Frank is coming?
I'm doing it.
Does that scare you?
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Just get outta my bed.
No. it's not Don.
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I did. are you?
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
What?
You look beautiful to me.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back. 
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
How is Central these days?
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
I don't know. you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
No way. I'm about to blow up.
You saw a lot in one night.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
Did you see her undressed?
See ya tomorrow.
Shoot.
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Alright.
That sounds great!
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Okay.
Motherfucker works fast.
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
Five-thousand per kilo.
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
Excuse me?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
No.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.
Nice doing business with you, George.
Get me a six pack.
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
No, my brother.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
But you must.  It's the only way.
I just got released five minutes ago.
Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on...
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Mexico.
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country.
Yes.
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
Sure.
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
I'm going to California.
...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
You're not going to trial?
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
Why are you smiling?
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
Yeah.
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
You can call me Dad if you want.
Shhhh.
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
Yeah?
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
And here?
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
Third group.
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
Go away.
It's a question of habit ...
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
Let's hope forever.
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
You got something on the Coke?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
Not sure.  I'll have everything you need tomorrow.
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
No.
What induced it?
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
Aren't they all?
Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm building a case against her, remember?
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
How did he look?
Yes.
She was here?
Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
I had a bad heart.
Can you give the court an example?
Did you ever see her again after that?
No.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Yes.
We dated for about a month last year.
I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial.
Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile?
I suppose.
I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
Yes.
Yes.
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
Dristan nasal spray.
No.
Then you would have gotten your money?
And she left shortly after that?
How?
I know.
Is it against the law?
It's not my taste.
Hi, Frank.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it?  To let go of what you want?
Why would she lie?
No -- I'm a survivor.
Why?
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
Really?
What's she like?
Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
We have to talk.
Where have you been?
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
It didn't get there from me.
Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Well, that's a long time.
It's not that long.
Oh Jesus.
Why are there two deeds here?
What?!
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
I never knew that.
You're right -- that is sick.
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
Oh, yes.
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
Sure.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
And clean.
Much.
But I... We don't even know each other.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
I'd appreciate it. I like knowing who I'm stealing from. If you can't create art I think the least you can do is recognize it around you, don't you think? There is...  ... so much beauty.
Are you all right?
I told you, I love other people.
What made you ask such a question?
Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea.
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
No. I can't. Not yet.
How about Italy?
Have you ever been to that station?
I bet you could do a book.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
Uh-huh. And?
Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it?
No one's asking you to!
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
Then he can move! People move!
What about us? What about me?
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
But now that you have it -
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
Yes. And I've accepted.
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
Later. Go back to sleep.
Frannie.
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
I don't.
Hell no!
Yeah?
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
We met.
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
You mean as opposed to your life?
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
Please.  It's for your own good.
You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.
My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
Why?
Lucky thing.
The dead get out?
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
Here!
Don't call me that.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
It was just like in my head.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool.  But I think we can do better.
Why not?  He eats everything else.
But the place burned to the ground.
Evidence of what?
No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
Two point one seventy-six.
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
All part of the business.
I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ... it's fucking dark in here.
What are you going to do with it?
I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
What are you talking about?
It was him.  I'm positive.
I've seen the way he looks at you. He's always wanted you.  Maybe two million dollars finally bought you.
Just hurry.
Don't tell him --
Everything you couldn't.
Oh, right.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
Are they really?
I knew it.
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
Not exactly.
...  yes.
Basically.
How long have you been with him?
Shit, here we go.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
I don't.
For what?
If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
You think I'm lying?
Yeah.
Then what?  Exactly.
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Yeah, twice.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
Fine.
Thank you.
I won't.
okay, all right.
Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
I know you will.
I want a second opinion.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
Forget it.
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
What do you mean?
...it's a problem...
What is Treadstone?
Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
Keep it. 
You have your passport?

You are a friend of his?
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.

It's a little late for that.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
Looks familiar?
No.  No.  Go around.  Keep going...
I guess.
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
But the police --
-- how? --
-- forget it --
What is that?
I don't know. 
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
I can't protect you anymore.
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
Hang on... 
Enhance it.
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
...ampered. with it, Spoor.
What? You mean you've got ...
It's reply paid.
Oh, right ...
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
He will be pleased when he comes home.
David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
Gillian Layton?
Jack!
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
Christ! You do know it all!
You killed him?
Er ... no.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
We don't make mistakes.
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
Jack ...
You think these are tits don't you?
Ah.
I don't know.  Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say.
Why?
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?
Looking for you.
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
Well, all wars do -
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Get away!
Are you still following me?
Yes.
Where are you going?
Don't do anything silly.
The refund for Tuttle!
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
What?
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
You haven't switched it on.
Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there! Go back to your office and I'll give you a knock when I've finished.
Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.  That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much.
What have you done with his body?
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Er, don't you want to search me?
But I could be anybody.
It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was?
Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
Are you saying this is illegal?
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
Go on, get outta here, Pierce, before I give you a big hug.  I love this guy.
No, no, that's impossible.
You can trust me on this one.
We are virgins.
He flipped out.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
What about Kanita?
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it.
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
I guess there's always a chance.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
You never know.
That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
Our Lady of Misery.
I'll be right down.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
Sure.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
Maybe I should come up with you.
Promise you won't go inside.
Thanks.
She's no whore, Marcus.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
I need a drink, that's all.
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
That's all right, we're not meant to do Oh tonight. Something is going to happen. I can feel it.
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
Let me think.
That's ridiculous.
Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
And the rule was...
Nothing.  I think you really blew the lid off nookie.
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
I don't think so.
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
Good night.
Call if you get weird.
Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
I'm going to take it.
Yeah --
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
No.
Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines.
My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
Yes?
I spent a fortune on this.
Should I...
Bobbie, please.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
I see the change in you -- I see it.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
Honey?...
You don't have to finish tonight.
That would be great.  It better help.  What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?
I trust you.
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
I don't write.
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
Me!
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
Because you're nuts.
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
Well, when?
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
Then you should stay here.
Go ahead -- what?
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
You're saying stay away from him.
It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.
Not anymore!
I already told you I'm not.
You're breaking my concentration!
Are you a virgin?
Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.
Here here...
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
Bye!
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
I hope this was made with egg whites!
Don't ask.
Oh come on!  Even you can see its value.
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
I know, man.
Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started taking it.
Yeah, right outside the door!
I didn't buy it I made it.
I didn't mean to.
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
Put it down, Walter.
Yeah?
Excuse me I have to make a call...
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
You are?
Well I'm overjoyed.
Yes, get rid of them...
Call me...Maxwell.
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
Suit yourself.
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
You don't have to do anything!
Gee.  Thanks.
Let it inspire you.  Maybe it will let you think of me.
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
Litter, yeah!
Amazing!
Bummer metaphor.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
Probably.  What movie is this?
Don't tread on the earth?
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
I do?  I guess I do.
'Bye.
Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
I'm here with Jenny.
They were vampires, weren't they?
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
Mmkay.
Who?
A dress.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
You're the boss, boss.  I just thought maybe we should wait.
'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
Cafe Blase.
Yeah, whoops I came.
To bring you... your birthright.
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
None of your business.  God.
We'll cover it later.
But you enjoyed it, yes?
No -- you don't have to --
I had to test you.
I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
Oh, fuck you!
Well, you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
And where are they now?
What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
No.  It was mondo bizarro.
You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
My parents have money...
Well, I hope so.
Okay.
Right.
As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Just till I lose.
No.
Crash says I gotta quit worrying about him--c'mon, honey, we got a lotta catching up to do--
Don't worry.
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
Annie, I think you should leave.
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
What's it say?
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
You got a live arm there.
You need a nickname.
Never heard of 'em.
I'm 0 for 16!  Gimme some of that shit.
Beg me!
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
You're the boss.
What do I gotta do?
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
I'm nervous--my old man's here.
You fuck!
I ain't hitting a man first.
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it.  I gotta run--
Ain't he warning up?
C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
Ain't here.
Good to see ya.  William would you...
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
But what happens when they do find out?
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
It's a pity in this...
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
Hey!
You fuckin' piece of shit.
Lester...
Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't...
That's right.
I can't! I'm tied!
And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
No.
What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
Nope, there's no way.
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
Yeah?
Yeah.
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
...to me.
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Why?
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
Yeah.
Well...
Well...
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
I'll come by.
Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Half of everything is mine.
Half - I'm comin' down. 
We can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
What is it?
Hey, Mitch.
Good luck.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
I'm not crying. 
Uh-huh.
You sure?
It's nice isn't it?
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
Yeah, how do I know?
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
Pretty serious.
With what?
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
Fuck you!
You threw it away?
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
What did Jennifer have?
Mm.
Oh...
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
Oh, sh-
Get - get up!
I wouldn't do that...
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
That's amazing.
There was nothing to it.  It was my pleasure.
Okay, I'll -
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
I really think you're -
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
Green?
Can't do it with both hands?
Can you do it with your left hand?
So, you're a righty?
Is this yours? Your pen?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
I'll to the FBI!
Jeff, would you go in with her?
Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
You've gotta be kidding me! 
I did - I didn't -
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine.
He's not here?
Uh-huh.
Stay out of the way!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now, go!']
No. I ain't see anything like that.
Hm.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
And how are things going down there?
Hi, how are you?
Okay, Sammy.
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Let me think about that.
Sure did.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Yeah.
Nicky, please...
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
What about my money?
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
Get lost?
Come on! 
Yeah.
You are.
God... I wish you...
You do?
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
Right.
I just talked to him.
He's sittin' by the phone -
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
Come here, come here.
You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in.
This is Nick.
They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready.
They're havin' a good time too.
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
What?
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Fuck you!
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
What's the matter with you?
Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.
In women?
You say that like an amnesia victim.
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
You're probably right.
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
No it's not.
Winning.
What do you want from me?
My dog!
He didn't remember to roll up his window...
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
Absolutely.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
You turned around!
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life.
I'll let you know.
But I'm blind.
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
Pretty good...Mom, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate...letting me stay, getting me the job--I've been a mess. I'm still a mess. It's just...we have to start having a different conversation. I can't take..
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..
We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
You going to talk all day?
I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
I didn't hurt you.
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
How was I in the wrong?
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
Why would I do that?
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
I'm the one they'd be looking for.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
Make a "U" and go back.
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Shit!
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
I'm not looking to get myself killed.  I just hope the battery on this phone holds out.
How much time do you have left on it?
And that was the end of it?
Pictures.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
I can hear you again, clearly.
I'm trying to.
What do you mean?
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
I might still get there first. The lights are with me.  How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
It won't be him.
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
You can't give up.
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
Shit.  You couldn't be in much worse shape.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
You, I would've noticed.
You could've hit me.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
Why are we stopping?
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
Naturally.
Who is this?
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
Pass.
Got a phone in that van?
You'll see her.
We're waiting for the light to cross the highway.  It just changed.  We're in a grey van.  It reads "<u>Noble Carpet Cleaners</u>."
It's in the process.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
I think I've already had a "quickie."  Thank you.
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
At those prices I'd just as soon your cabbie didn't get a look at me.
Doesn't everybody?
Thanks.
Who knows the secrets of the human heart.
Ask him yourself.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
You fucking did.
It's Dave.
Consider it how you like. Just get that bloody tart out of here.
Off his wages.
He's Scottish, Col.
Not me.
Perform?
You on the game?
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
No, I didn't --
I wonder.
What'll it be?
Whiskey.
Yes...
Maybe.
What do you think?
Didn't think I could.
Did he dance with you?
Want to look after you.
Nothing's wise.
Ask to meet me again.
All right, they do.
Delirious.
Don't.
Do you like me even a little bit?
You like me better like this.
Sorry. What you doing?
For you...
Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy.
You mean that?
In a manner of speaking.
Love me.
You do?
Anything.
Never.
I promise.
Don't call me that --
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
Fergus.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
All right, then. I like to be wise.
Do you now.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
So you did fuck up.
No, what is the thing?
You're never out, Fergus.
Do you want a cup of tea?
You sure?
I told him.
Who'd you think it was?
Aye, I do, Peter.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
I seen your fucking face.
So I've noticed.
Do what?
Don't you think of it, fucker.
Why not?
Don't I know it.
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
Never.
Why?
We got simple tastes, you and me.
I've often wondered how you do it.
But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
Stop it --
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
You won't run.
I said you bastard -- stop --
And you know what?
Yes, but --
No -- I guess not.
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
Well -- come on.
The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?  Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back.
No thanks.
Only we call them agents.
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Oh, I see.
I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
Describe him.
No.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
That's the spirit.
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Brian.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
The view had better be worth it.
I met a man with sharp nails.
Scobie?
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
There -- you're a new man.
Come here.
I'm not fifteen.
Who told you to do that?
That sounds like their problem.
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
Or Tex?
Who?
How much is it worth?
Forty-five thousand.
And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
Why bother him?
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
But his mother --
I don't know.
One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
And this?
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
We won! We won!
No -- but I will ask.
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Please, not on my account.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Now you're angry.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Charles is.
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
Come on. You can't stay here.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
How do you shave in there?
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
A quarter of a million dollars.
Do you tell lies?
Ça alors! From Charles?
I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable.
I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
How can you tell?
He's allergic to him.
The American Embassy.
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
Oh la vache!
Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
Good.
Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
That's impossible.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
Not much further.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.
We need you here. I can bring her in.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
St. Michael's.
She works at a church?
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Why?
Daddy....
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
I really do. For your own safety.
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
You think you're my sister?
Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
No.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
Stag?
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
You're sweet. I really wish someone had thrown a party like that when I was your age. My life might have been very different.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
What?
Jody, we've been going out for over a year. I love you but I'm all out of patience.
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
I do not.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
I don't know. I kind of am.
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman?
I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
NO!
Are you Jody?
What?
Unfair?!
Okay, okay.
EXT. ROAD - DAY.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?

Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
Why don't I--?
I need your help.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
...truck.
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
You want cash?
I need your truck!
That dog ain't mean.
...-ed.
Do you wanna give me a minute?
Yeah, borrowed!

What?
All right.

I was thankin' you, asshole!

...I believe in live and...

Oh!

Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
Come on, old Pete.
Get over!  Get over!
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
...Night Shift, but you might...
Come on, old...
...Pete.  Come on.
Come on.
What the fuck was that?!
Holy--!
 Okay.  That didn't work.


 Shit. 
 Go, go.
All right.
Yeah...
...man!

You're fucked, man.
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
...-tion?
...piece of shit was worth.
Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
...shit.
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
...man.
Bring him down!
Hey!
Huh?
They're movin'.
Arlo, shut up.
Hey, hey, hey.

What?

 Okay.
 Okay.


You got Elvis?!
Go!
Oh, shit.
What do you think I'm doin'?!
 It says forty- nine.


 There's gotta be...
...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Stop limpin' around like that.
You, Arlo.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
We're worried...
Listen, shithead!
...without compunction.
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
We do need your truck.

Thank you.
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
I'd say we're about even.

Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
...and the government.
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
...always done, Richard?
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
I'll do it.

INT. LONG'S CAR - NIGHT.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
...-ther orders?
You can't fire on them.  You're gonna detonate the crystals.
...here!
Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
Elvis is fuckin' dead, man.  Get yourself some CDs.


...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
...it.
Uh, we both like to fish.
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
It must've happened right after we left.
Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
...colonel?
...-five.
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?

...is a perfect hunter.
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
How much longer for the range and power projections?
...Mason?
Forty-seven.
You redneck idiot, do you have...
EXT. U.S. ARMY RESEARCH LABORATORY/GUARD GATE - JEROME - NIGHT.
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/BOX - DAY.
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAY. 
...-damn phone.
Take it easy, Jake.
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
An honest living.
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
That's too bad.
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Yeah.
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
Either that or she'll be in jail.
Just bring your checkbook.
Ain't worth thinking about.
Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly.
No thanks.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
Curly, you know how long I been in business.
Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do? So he says what do they do? His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while. Just listen a second, Duffy...
Okay.
The apple core club.
C'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! Now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Looks like you went quite a distance.
I have?
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
Mr. Gittes.
You mean you don't know where you were?
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
No reason.
Of course I'm sure.
What about you? Do you and your father get along?
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
It has to do with my father.
You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
Then let's go talk to her.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
Sure.
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
You know any good criminal lawyers?
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
...no...
Katherine?... Katherine who?
She's my sister and my daughter!
To Mexico...
Back to Mexico.
He's in the dark room.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
When did you come in?
You'll find one of those people.
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
I cut myself shaving.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
I never was.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
Then go home and forget about it.
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go in and wait?
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
He owned it.
They're all a bunch of phonies.
Fifty lire... 
What you find tonight on the floor between the seats? 
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
That's right, Modern Times.
Is there a woman?...Tell me the truth...  There is a woman.
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.
No...
You never used to do that!
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
Thais.
I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
You don't really think so?
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
Well, well - isn't that nice?
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Just old age.  It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of.  You ought to see Mr. Leland.  There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to.
Yes.
Certainly not.
I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
And the notice?
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
No.
What's the matter with you?
Toothache.
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
You're no Venus de Milo.
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
Susan, I really think -
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me or anybody else!  You want to be loved - that's all you want!  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me!  Don't expect me to love you -
I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one.  I don't even know what a gentleman is.  You see, my idea of a gentleman, Mrs. Kane - well, if I owned a newspaper and if I didn't like the way somebody else was doing things - some politican, say - I'd fight them with everything I had.  Only I wouldn't show him in a convict suit, with stripes - so his children could see the picture in the paper.  Or his mother.  It's pretty clear - I'm not a gentleman.
You can't.
Where'm I going?
Can you prove it isn't?
Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
All right.
Lock it - and keep it locked.
Yes?
Yes?
Why, Brad?
She's going to leave you -
You might have made the whole thing less personal!
Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
Was he in love?
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
Yes, sir.
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
You wouldn't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr. Charlie Kane.
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
Rosebud?
You think I'm shitting you...
He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way.
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
You can hold me down.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
You two better quit it.
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
It's not what you think.
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
You work in a market, all right.
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
He's not invited.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
You're such an asshole.
I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.  See you later, handsome.
What time was this?
Pack of cigarettes.
How 'bout covering point!? You suck!
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
I wanted to use your car.
What do you two fight about?
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Oh yeah.
I'm talking to myself here.
Return of the Jedi.
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
So?
Each egg has to be perfect.
Nudie booth?
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
All of them.
Why not?
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Veronica!
The best Burtless movie ever made.
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
You've had sex with a dead person.
If you go, I go.
That's embarrassing?
He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
I want to rent a movie.
There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
I know I'm your hero.
No way!
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're happy?
Hey, what about Veronica?
It's the same thing with Veronica.
Leave her out of this.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
Am I right or what?
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
How do you figure?
Same time. What about you?
I'll call you. Let you know.
Get the fuck outta here already.
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I know I can bench more than that!
See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
Yeah.
Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
We were going to start again, I think.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob.
Actually, that's his night job.
Oh... Can I help you?
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
Hunhh? Nothing.
You're trusting.
Ooh! Can we?!
How do you figure?
How many girls have you slept with?
I want you to come with me on Monday.
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
Please calm down.
This is different. This is important. How many?!
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Goodbye, Dante.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
I like the way you think.
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Twenty bucks?
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
What usually eats a banana?
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
This is where your background in police work comes in handy--ask the questions, Travers.
Suits, underwear, 100 million dollars...the usual stuff. Travers was smart enough to bring along a tracking device.  Step into my office.
A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
The clip's not gonna hold!
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
My pleasure.
Three...
You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!
Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
Where've you been?
After the funeral I just had to leave.
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
Flare up of old emotions...
Where?
Hal knows what he's doing.
You know me, I'm a night person.
Of course I do.
Can't do it.  Now go back and get help!
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
And miss all of this peace and quiet?  Never, right Hal?
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
Now you get burned.
There is.
Who's going with you?
Do you always transport through the air?
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
Kill him when he gets down.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
Yes. They want to help.
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
What would you like to know, sir?
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
I beg your pardon?
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Thank you, Fred. Thank you. Minister turns and signals. Door opens and a crowd of cameramen and reporters rush in. Aides push two 6-foot loudspeakers and a Hi-Fi on a trolley.
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
Brown hair, is it?
No, sir.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
Vitamins will it be then?
But it was horrible.
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Amen. They cross themselves.
Prison custody?
Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
The ride is free.
...Bottega.  Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer.  You?  Definitely Clarence Darrow.
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
You still carrying passengers?
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
You're kidding me.
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
Of course.
Can't say that I do.
Neither do I.  But my children, they're still young.  Do you know who they like even more than jolly old Saint Nicholas?  His helper, Black Peter. An old Russian fairy tale tells of how Santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids.  That was Black Peter's job.  He was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night.  And if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door.  That was a warning.  If they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. And they would never be seen again.
Twenty five?
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
By the way.  Daniel said he was sorry.
Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
You guys been holding hands?
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
Elvis?
What's your name?
What's he sayin'?
Yo, whassup?
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
You mean like benefits?
It's not that kind of job.
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
I don't think I can do this.
Yeah.
...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  Get in the fucking car.
Two...
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
What'd he do to you?
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
I don't understand...
Yes, Max?
That's the point.  You play <u>between</u> the notes, you dance <u>around</u> the structure, you improvise.  Some people know where they're going to be ten years from now.  Same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over.  That's not living.  That's dying a little every day.  Not me, pal.  It's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living.  That's jazz.  That guy up there, he knows what I'm talking about.  Hell, it's the same thing <u>he's</u> talking about, if you just open your ears.  You can hear it in the conversation he's having with that trumpet...
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
Oh, I'm captivated.
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Yeah?  What happened?
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
You get benefits?
You had to kill Heller?!
Who's Heller?
What's at Union Station?
There you go...!
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
As in...? 
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
I should have done that.  Fixed it and more.  Get out from under what I been under...
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
Who?
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
Drop me off here!
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
Shut the hell up.
Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
Not for years.
Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
You switched the charts; you tell me.
Really?
Them who?
And look here.  Cease fire in Chechenia.  That's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons.  Listen to this, some gas company in Colorado.  Their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive.  They've accused the E.P.A. of, quote, 'turning a blind <u>eye</u> to the future.'
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
The whole kit and caboodle of 'em are British Intelligence agents. <u>Spies</u>.  Jerry Garcia had a double- o rating.  Just like James Bond.
This would be it?
Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
You will?
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
That's great.  Good for you.
The truth shall make you free.
Terminal?
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
Yes, that's right.
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
-- Understood.
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
Wasn't my idea.
That you come with me.
Yes, sir.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
No doubt.
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
Ellie --
Ellie.
Do you have a minute -- ?
As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
Good luck, David.
Well --
A third layer.
No primer.
How can that be?
1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
It's beautiful.
Can you show me?
Many others.
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
I thought you were here because you want to go.
-- I'm moving to Washington.
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
Wait -- hold on a minute --
How do you mean?
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
Can you try?
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
If you came back.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
What are you so afraid of?
-- I don't know --
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
What are you doin' here?
She took off with that convertible feller...
Gotta go, Arletta.
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
Hey, Tattoo!
What happened? How far did you get?
Shut up. Let him eat. Don't pay them no mind, boy.
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
Boy. You jus' asking to be handled!
Fifty's a nice round number.
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
And all the time you was plannin' on runnin' again.
On my own.
But what am I gonna do all by myself?  Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.
Do we even get our same bunks back?
You just said he could eat anything.
Oh mah baby Luke.
Cuter.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
Damn.
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
None of your fucking business.
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
I know.  Do come and meet your guest.
Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
When he was seventeen.
I never hurt nobody...
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
The door was already open...
She's supposed to have it.
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
Where are you, Peter?
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here.
Is he out?
Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
You're afraid of him.
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
You do that one, I don't want it...
Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
I know, baby.  I know.
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
Tell it to your shrink.
Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it...  She wasn't killed here.
Look at him, grandstanding...
The woman's unstable.  You could wind up with a harassment charge. <u>Anything</u>.  You're like some horny little teenager.
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
Good.
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
You're damn right I do.
We were together six years, sir!
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself.  Where're you?
I'll listen for you buzzing over.
Well, yes.  You're getting out of bed tomorrow. They want you to walk.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
I'd like to go back. James...
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
Yes.  They felt like traffic accidents.
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
Yes.
It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
I want to see my mother immediately.
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
I don't want to hear anymore.
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
Yeah, it'll be fun.
What about the engagement party?
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
You look beautiful.
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
When did you start smoking?
I've already made arrangements.
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
No.
By color.
What if it's got a pattern?
You took bets on my diagnosis?
I've already checked it out 17 times.
Very romantic setting.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
So are you engaged, or what?
The left one.
Don't be ridiculous.
Really?    Me too.
Break up?    They wish.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
Lie down.
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
I love your apartment.
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly.
It's hard to know where to start.
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
Oh, God, Michael, I know.  Why does everything have to be so hard?
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
You can get out of the dinner.
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
Yes, I suppose so.
Especially now.
So, I've been thinking a lot...
What?
Wired?    I ain't wired.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
They left about a half hour ago.
Should I call you back?
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
I'm good.   Really.
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
I guess we're going to find out.
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
I can't believe you didn't check.
I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
I've got a way with people.
I don't know.     I didn't look.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
No, that's not Mr. Taylor.
No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!
You see that car?
What does arresting us get them?
Something like that.
It's for you.
This Jade Fox is a woman?
I do as I please.
What's it to you?
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
Real sharpness comes without effort.
Tell me, who is your master?
Shut up!
I owe you nothing.
So what if I don't?
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Come and get it if you can.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.
Give it back!
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
Perhaps.
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
I heard Sir Te lost something.  And now Madame Te's not feeling well...
"We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill."  Good, the fox is out of her hole.
Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
Thanks, babe.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
You're welcome.
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
I went to see a friend of mine.
Take the dope, too.
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
I'm already alone.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
You heard me.
What do you mean?
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
Forever.
No.
No.
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Why are you being so dramatic?
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
What'cha reading?
Because you act like a pig.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.
It's my house.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
How was your date?
Wait, don't hang up.
Reading.
I will.
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
Oh please.
What?
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
Lighten up.
Fine.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Hi.
I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
- none taken -
I don't think that bothered him.
Outstanding.
Doctor King is my favorite.
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
Eyes closed.
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
I don't know.
Why?
It's Kathryn.
Well... not exactly.
Well what then?
My mom? Don't call my mom.
Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway.
I swear.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
I'm sorry.
No. This is going to be our last session.
It works a little.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
Honey, is something wrong?
Who told you?
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
What?
I see your point... though why should I care?
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
Could you be more desperate to read it?
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
No.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Any day now.
What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in.
No, tell me.
Excuse me?
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
Is that what you think?
I have a flair for drama.
You wanted an answer to your question.
Come again?
Didn't you hear what I said?
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
Absolutely.
Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
You're a lucky guy.
What are you talking about?
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
What do you mean?
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Oh, you'll remember it some time.
Oh, lots of times.
I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
Are they nice?
What's her name?
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
Yes, darling,
Times have changed.
You're shouting at me.
That's the Farren house.
But I told her to go with you.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
Can't you tell me later?
It was on account of the birthday party.
I have eyes too, and I tell you no one's there. If you deny that, if you insist that this woman you call your friend is in the garden, then I'm afraid I shall have to punish you. Do you understand?
Irena. But who are you?
I shall want you for always.
Oh, thank you, Amy.
I shall wear it in my hair!
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead.
That's a fine-looking ring.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
Mommy read it to ne.
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
Yes...yes, that's true.
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
Go on -- out with you.
And Amy mailed them?
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
Yeah that's like a three bagger. Today a bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that's really hot. So hot you gotta put several condoms on to dull the senses.
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
What does that have to do with me?
Anything's better than Mark.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
I don't know.
Maybe they have to pee.
To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
I looked like an Italian man!
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Okay, I gotta go.
Yeah, I guess. Mark?
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
Hide him.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
Hey, how about a little nightcap?
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
I'm working on it...
This really isn't a good time.
I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?
Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
I'm sorry.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
They do? Oh no...
No, it was our first date.
No, take it.
Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
She's just so... pathetic.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Madonna's in Penthouse?
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their natural state.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
What makes her think that?
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
I'm afraid so.
Yes.  This way.
Yes, sir.
Good.
Shut-up.
Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
Not that.  Anything else.
A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone.
There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
Your name is John White.
Tell me about them...
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
I have to go...
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
Right.
I promise.  I won't.
What the hell is this ?
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
This is mine, Al -- all mine ... I made him. I built him.  And no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be Vice President of the United States!
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Exactly. A condition.
Yes.
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
And...
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
Clean.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
Oh.  Fine.
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
Just what you think I mean.
Dave -- I'm working.
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
I'm not sure.
You could buy it on payments.
Well -- take care.
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
I'm afraid so.
Fine.
We vetoed that?
They re not my attack dogs.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
What about it?
Certainly.
Thanks, Duane.
I'm outta here.
You don't change, do you, Bill?
Oh, I don't think so.  Still, you helped a lot of people.
What?
I can't.
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
The tunnel.
I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.
Quiet!
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
What?
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
No wonder they're so....hungry.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
Sir!
Not as bad as yours, pal.
We need fuel, and a couple automatics.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
Knox?
But why?
The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me.  Damn it, it's gonna happen!  I feel it.  She's going to be mine!
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?  If all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
what?!
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
What's his specialty, brown-nosing?
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
Chet...
Knox!  what are you doing here?
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
God, if Chet found out he'd...
Dead Poets honor.
Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
I didn't know you taught.
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
A barbaric yawp.
AHHHHHH!
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
A sweaty-toothed madman
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
I have something.
All poetry was acceptable.  The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
Okay.
You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
Then you're playing a part for him too, aren't you?  A dangerously self- destructive one.
Screw it all.  I don't give a damn about any of it.
The god of the cave.
Todd, if you're gonna make it around here, you've gotta speak up.  The meek might inherit the earth but they don't get into Harvard. know what I mean?
Yes.  But
What?
A play, dummy.
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
It is?  Happy Birthday.  You get anything?
Yes, and acting!  It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. Most people, if they're lucky, live about half an exciting life! If I could get the parts, I could live dozens of lives.
Yes.
We're going to die here! We're going to die!
Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
Jesus Christ lady...
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
Takes one to know one.
Yeah...
And what if I run into one of those things?
Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
I'm looking...
Fucking women, man...
Those are mine!
It's gotta!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
I love this car. Some cars sit, you know? This car, a car like this... grows. I mean you never know, with a car like this, where this car has been.
Yeah.
Sure. Why not.
But I insist.
But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
I came to see Merle.
Too bad.
Yeah?
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
Okay.
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
I... No. You do this for money?
No. No, no.
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
So do I.
Yeah.
Fucking A.
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Well, where's he from?
Huh?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
What do you think?
Sit down.
Then lemme have 'em.
You gotta learn, Vince! You come out here... You got no jacket, you got no pants, you got no knife and you got no boots. You think everyone's gonna take care of you! That's what you always think, but this time you're wrong. This time you're on your own!
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
What?
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
No.
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Yeah.
In the timeless words of Squire Albert...
Technothugs?
Kimberly!
No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
Jury found you guilty, not me.  I just called it as I saw it.  Fuck that.  You were brought here for a reason.  Doucet's escaped.  Re-animated for his parole hearing.  Killed a lot of people.  Most of them cops.
Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.
Out of the room.
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
I'm thrilled beyond belief.
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
Telephone repairman.
I don't want any press on this.  I've got an election to win day after to- morrow.
I got it.  I got it.
When you're frozen, you're legally dead, right?
You can't catch this man with a computer.
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March.
Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
You want to be a good detective?
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
Guess there will, if it says so.
And what about Daniel Webster?
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
Belle.
Some other time, Stevens.
Don't say that -- I know it is --
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
About what?
They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
Well, I --
Morning, Jabez.
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
Shake!
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Mary -- what would you do?
Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.
I'd love to.
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
Tired?
You'll never change -- will you?
Don't take cold, Jabez.  Come -- it's warm in here.
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
All right, son -- if it helps.
I dunno.
Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance.
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go--
The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
I won't forget.
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
That's okay.  This is my first time riding in one.
You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.  I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
Tell me about it.
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?
Yeah.  How'd you know?
I said we'll talk later, Roy.  If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray.
Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
Roy?
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
Yessir.
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
What about the kids?
Don't call yourself fat.
They're not after you, they're after me.
Listen, it's late already when I realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and Sal.  I couldn't get a baby sitter.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Hello, Sonny.
Yeah.  So how are you?
I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
Well...
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
I like that... yeah!
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
... But you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time... You got it?  Okay?
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
I'm not alone.
I frisk you?
You frisk me.
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
Yeah ...
Don't fuck with me ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
It's all we got.
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
Special to me, too.
Sure - we like you.
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
Yeah.
What about Howard?
You were terrific, too!
My body?  What for?
Let's go, Sonny.
Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
Does that still go?
Oh, Jesus!  Hey.  How about food? I forgot to ask to have food on board.
I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
Open this up!
... Just give me time to think...
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
Maybe!  Aw Christ, what dreams you live on!  Maybe what?
Robbing a bank.
Newsman, not ...
<i>My theft insurance policy will have to fork over the ten million... but that will take six to eight months due to Nevada state law.</i>  <i>But you should know sir... that I employ bounty hunters. My bounty hunters can find these thieves.</i>
<i>Morning.</i>
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
That bitch called me a bitch.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
I said stop it.
Just shut up and do what they say. They're gonna kill us if we don't, Ian.
She went up to her room.
Real good.
Real fast.
Two dollars!  Forget it!
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
What makes Sammy run?
Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
What are you so worked up about?
I truly hope so.  I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
Mister Señor Love Daddy, I'd like to dedicate the next record to my heart, Tina.
Fuck!  My money!
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
That's my name.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Tonight, when we close.
Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
Where we goin'?
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
Make dat money.  Get paid.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
No rawness.
Later for you.
Meda.  Meda.
Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
I am a man.
Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
People are free to do what they wanna do.
Sounds funny to me.  As much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers."
It's e-vit-able.
I love you, Black.
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Can you do better?  C'mere.
Tell Vito.
I'm sick of niggers, it's a bad neighborhood.  I don't like being around them, they're animals.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Heddo Jeth-ica.
Ooh gross.
Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I think they've been doing it for years.
No, I'm fine thanks.
I'm just not ready.
I haven't seen you around here before.
Just a guy I hang out with.
Exactly! A pirate!
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
Now you see why he was elected principal?
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
Shut up!
You have beautiful eyes.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
Hey, let's go spy on them.
I made the polar bear pants.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
And like she said, do it before the parade.
Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
I don't think that'll happen. We've learned a valuable lesson we won't ever forget.
So can I come along?
You mean the lunch room?
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's not your tape.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
Do we have a deal?
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!
Yes you are. 
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
And I you.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
Oh wow. Look at you.
I think you'll make a good teacher.
And...?
It's a surprise.
What papers?
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
This band sounds terrible.
Well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.
They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
Yes?... How was your journey?
Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
No, but many consider my training valuable.
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
As the legend says.
That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham.  I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.
Is he....?
You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
Yes...
No.
Always?
Why do they come?
We call that one Muad'dib.
Pain.
What is it?
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Did they try and fail?
My father sent you to test me. Music then?
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
Thank you.
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
Do you want me to get it for you?
No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
Of course!
Nah.  This happens all the time...
Forget about it.  We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again.
Mmph?  Where am I?
Eddie, you screwed up.
But maybe not.
Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
No problem.  I know it by heart...
This is the big moment...!
H-how'd you know?!
I'm Criswell.  I know all.
I don't understand.
I made it up.  It's horseshit!
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
But there's plenty of other parts.
Like <u>what</u>?!
That's right...
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
What other sixty-thousand?
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
Really?!  Well good for you.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
Raising money is tough.
It's plenty!  It's the acorn that will grow a great oak.  I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as "Bela Lugosi's Final Film"
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
I like to think so.
Yes?
Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
You gotta be kiddin' me.
Isn't he dead?
I don't think he's a schmuck.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!
Why not??
How long's he been here?
I just picked them up on the way over...
Oh.  Okay.
Bela died.
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
Yes!  BINGO!  Solar energy!  Oh that's gonna seem so scientific.  This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film.  <u>No compromises</u>.
Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it!
Lines around the block.
So don't take it too seriously. We're all doin' great work.
Well it looks good.  Let's use it!
Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!
YES!  JUST DO IT!
You know, to make the legs move --
I do.
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment!
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
What if I'm vomiting?
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
They celebrated the common person.
No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley.
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
You know what would be great?
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
I'm not sure about the entire concept.
Yes?

What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Right, right...
Send him away.
Hey, he cheated on her.
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
Could've been a nurse?
What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean...
I'm at the hospital.
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!
What is she, at work?
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Dynamite.
Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
Ha!
Oh... how come?
Oh God, this is so weird.
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
I missed you.
... yeah, then, but...
So?
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
What did you do to your hair?
I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while.
I'm making a tape.
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot.  Hi.
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
You watching the ballgame?
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
You brought the cameras here!
Please!
Save it.
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
Me?! That's you!
The whole time? Eighteen years?
Do you still have it?
What is? Oh, dinner!
Ohh... do you own a cat?
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
You're kidding, right?
You know what they say about the early bird.
Thanks, Mr. M.
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Plenty of pep, too.
Why are you doing this?
Take as much room as you want
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
Here?
points at the motel.
Still clear?
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
What do you mean?
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
I don't care.
I mean at you.
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
When they deserve it.
So you saved her.
I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
Captain, what do you want?
Call me Dudley.
Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
Ma'am, I'm sure she was.
Maybe.  I don't know.
Yeah.  A great big one.
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
<u>Lynn</u>.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
Richard Stensland.
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
I don't know.  I swear it!
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
Susan Lefferts.
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
<u>Throwing me</u>?
You make a mistake?
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
Why?
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
You, me and White, huh?
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
A sweet man.
Where'd you hear that?
Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?
Yeah.  Me neither.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Oh?  Anyplace else?
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
<u>They</u> said he was behind an extortion scheme.
I'm telling you, I--
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Really?
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
None of your business.
I was a traffic analyst.
Welcome to Santa's Workshop.
The NSA killed him.
They're here.
You're driving.
Same thing?
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
How fast can you learn?
Not particularly, no.
With what?
Hello. Hello, Maria.
I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
Yes. I have her permission.
Is that good?
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
Why?
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
About what?
About the accident.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
No.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
To buy lingerie.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
I'm sorry.
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
It's not true.
Oh, please--
Leave this house.
Stacy--
Was that doctored-up, too?
It wasn't me.
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
My wife's Jewish. But that probably doesn't matter right now.
It tastes like fish.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Not that much.
When do I get to meet him?
Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
How can I be sure.
Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean. I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg.
You got a minute?
For the last four years.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
Rachel--
How?
Yeah.
You're wrong.
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
Bobby--
Good point.
I don't under--
The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
Because she's reading the newspaper, you asshole.
Really?
Do I know you?
The blender?
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Jesus.
Why would they--
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
We believe?
No sir.
Dean's with Lyle.
Do you have visual?
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
So why follow me?  Escort me, by all means.  Following me is predatory, isn't it?
Her or me?
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.
I believe you still have my book.
What do I love?  I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.
Arabic?
It's a long song - Szerelem means love…and the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool.  For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave.  He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -
Shall we be all right?
Would you let me pass?
I'm sorry, Katharine.
No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
What?  How could he have?  When?
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
Me?
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft…
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Marzipan!  I think you've got marzipan in your hair.  No wonder you're homesick.
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
Apprentices.
To arm-twisting.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
Thank you.
I'm turning you.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
I'm not sewing anything else.
No!
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
I try not to expect you.
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
It's what I've learned.
What if you couldn't find him…?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
We're getting close.
I don't know, but close.
I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
I'm in the middle.
That's good. Terrific.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
You can't.
Oh?
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
That's when we'll do it. And we'll need every single day.
Precisely. You give me the Mask security code, I steal the Mask, you get a finders fee. At ten percent, should be two or three million at least. Not too bad.
That's because I wanted them to!
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
Bookshelf. Sensors--
You're not on the beat.
It's your mistake.
There is no big job.
A billion dollars.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
That's because you grew up rich.
I'm leaving from the Nathan Road Station at 6:30 tomorrow morning. You could come too.
FUCKING THING!!!
But--
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
In the van.
The key to success is using the right tools.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
But the second mouse gets the cheese.
Check out my ball.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
Probably not.
Yeah. Probably not.
He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there.
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
So you say.
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for them.  You got a minute?
Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me --
They did?
Yeah.  I know.
Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
Bullshit, you don't.
Good.
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
They skipped that step.
Really?  It makes me sick.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.
Whoa.  No shit.
Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
Why the fuck should I respect her?
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
I wasn't gonna --
Good.
Right.
Did he say why?
That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
I do.
Yeah.  Sexy, huh?  And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is.  Seven is my son's age.  Two is how many times I been married and divorced.  You getting all this?  16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.
I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
No, I wanna say hi.
About what?
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
I need it.
I don't do favors for you anymore.
I will.  Bye.
That's okay.  I understand.
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.
Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other.  I just figured it was something in the genes.  And you know how it is -- you don't like to ask about things like that ...
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
I'm cold ... so cold ...
What happened?
Barks his Òright on!Ó
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
Of course, yes.  But now eat we must.  Good food, I have good food.  Come, come.
Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
I have felt it.
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
Yes, you do.
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
A mining colony.
No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...
Has Threepio turned up yet?
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
No.
Not really.
What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
Are the coordinates set?
That sounds familiar.
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
He'll survive.
Why not me?
I thought I was in good shape.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
That they are.
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
But tell me why ...
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
That won't be necessary.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
A display of primitive apparatus --
I don't believe it.
Yes, but don't take any chances.
It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
Go on now. Do as I say.
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
I tried...
He's... near.
All right, so I made another deal.
Somebody get off!
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.
I'm here.
It's history. I gotta go.
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
Later.
We'll see.
Down that way.
Are you crazy?
Who?
Who?
Well, I'll think it over.
Who ain't?
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
...Perceval!
--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
Move aside!
So be it, to the death.
But your life and lands are far from here.
And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law.
--It is the old wound, that has been opened. I have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed. Let my heart do its job, my King, and pump me empty...
Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
Ye...
I'm going.
Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
Because you and the land are one.
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
It is.
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
How about Lankaster Merrin.
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
Hi, how'd your day go?
Burke.
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Please.
Of course. Have you got a pen?
What's her name?
How are you today?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.
You could do it yourself...
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
Your kidding?
Oh............
Who's Captain Howdy?
Oh I bet he is.
Cause I like it.
I don't know
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Where'd you get it then?
You and Regan?
Quod nomen mihi est?
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
The Lord be with you.
Defender of the human race...
Can you give her something?
Yeah, a fall.
Are you tired?
O'Lord hear my prey.
Bastards! Stop!
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
Yes
It's my goddamn car!
Mondays.
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
They're falling out.
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
Two at a time?
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.
How we doing?
Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.
It's more than that.
Says who?
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
I don't know what you mean.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
What was it like?
Talk.
I been thinking maybe we should make some changes.  I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
It's not gonna hurt you.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
Just a lucky guess.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
Because I can hear it.
Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.  And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability.  Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
He was wearing a suit.
How come I didn't hear anything?
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
You weren't there.
Who's weak now, big brother?
This'll kill 'em.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
Yeah?
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
The audience was a little off tonight.
No, no.  You boys are tired.
All right.
The flu.
Doctor's orders.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
I'm sorry?
It's one of Jack's favorites.
What do you mean?
My watch is broken, too.
Punctuality.  First rule of show business.
So run a little longer.
Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
I sing now?
It's orange!
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
Right.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
You're a prince.
Right.
So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
First times. Hey, look at this.
It's paradise.  That's what it is. Paradise.
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
Well then ... shall we?
That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack.
How come?
Job.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
Thanks.
He doesn't bite.
Pretty much.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
The Stratford.
Huh?
I guess in case one year they're not.
In and out.
Just dinner and dance, right?
Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
You're upset.
You were good.
Who's Nina?
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Soap convention.
Huh?
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
He had a mind that escalated things.
Well, this is some surprise.  Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.
Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
I guess it's getting serious.
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
Oh, fine.
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
Yeah -- me.
Five.  No one knows you're his father.  I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you.
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
We need to talk.
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
-- Or maybe all at once.  There's a get-together tonight at New St. Marks. For all the bureau chiefs and their families.  He's insisted Jamie and I be there too.
The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
Don't count on it.
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
That's your name, isn't it?
Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
Just following your example.
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
Good.  Because I'm fed up.
Wait a second -- you hated Madonna.  Didn't you?
Ooh, my suits are ready...
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
Sure.
Mom liked it.
Great room...
Hey, is that really necessary?
I don’t care if you’re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can’t park here.
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You’re doing well...
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Yes you do...
I call all you white guys "Jack."
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
What?!
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
Do I look like I live in a bottle?
You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
Get out, I call 911.
Get out!
It’s lovely...
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
All in one tape?
Because you’ll be here.
It’s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven you’re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We don’t have time for wining and dining.
What’s in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes?
You had a heart attack?
No.  Well, maybe a few things.  But mostly just different...
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
It’s wonderful...
I don’t think I’d fight you on that one...
For the week?
What are you talking about, Jack?
I can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
Paris?
Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Not by a long shot.
But you’re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. You’re a scotch man, single malt, not because it’s trendy but because you’ve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand...
I'm taking the train...
Hey, kind of giving up Christmas day for my ex-boss here.
Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
Ben.  Are you okay?
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
It's easy for you to be patient.
<u>Now</u>.
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
I though we went over this.
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
Sure.
So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
What?  What do you mean you --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
Better than your <u>life</u>.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  <u>We</u> are.
Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
Raising the shields.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just <u>find</u> him.
Oh, I think you already have.
Skeptical...?
Here's the overall Target Area...
I know that. But what's the maximum?
Message to Proteus.
<Me>?
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
And take a little trip with them...
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
With no laser --
They're much smaller than bacteria...
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
What gives you that idea?
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
I know only too well what's in the balance, Doctor. And it's not my ego, damned or otherwise.
The Breath of God...
Quite a piece of plumbing.
Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
Go ahead.
Berserk nothing. He's the one who's been sabotaging the mission...  Get this on. Hurry!
Uh -- what?
No Jean, no money!
That's my license and registration. I wanna be in compliance.
Yeah, well, it depends on the artist. You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no complaints. Waiter!
Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin', we'll stop for pancakes, then we'll get laid. Wuddya think?
Geez. That's more'n I've heard you say all week.
Jezhush.
No, that's not it, Jerry.
Huh?
Yeah, you already said that.
Okay.
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera.
We need more -
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
Yah, okay, but, uh -
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...
End a April.
They can really take over, that's for sure.
Mr. Mohra?
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
Uh-huh.
Oh, man!
You're sayin' - what're you sayin'?
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
Sure right now! You're darned tootin'!
Yah, real good.
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
Okay, real good, then.
Be back in a minute. If Stan calls you, just tell him I went to Embers. Oh, geez -
Ya got the car?
You told me about it.
I mean a parking lot.
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Call 'em up.
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
Yah.
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
Oh, ya know, that's, uh - what can I say?...
It's okay...
Uh-huh.
Yah?
The day of our homicides.
They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
Should we?
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Worth every penny.
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
Please.
I wish I could return the favor.
Well... thanks, anyway.
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
... You know me?
Yes... it's a test.
Tyler Durden.
There's always that.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Delivered from bullshit colors like "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia."
I don't... think so.
Do what you like.
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
Where do you want it?  In the face?
Strange.
But a good strange.
Is it?
I know that.
I don't know how Tyler found the house, but he'd been there for half a year.
Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
"I get cancer, and I kill Joe."
If you could fight any celebrity?
Shatner.  William Shatner.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
You've gotta understand something about me.  I have a little rule, okay?  Don't ever talk to her about me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind of shit.
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
Guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this.
Tell him!
Imagine how he feels.
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
... is over.
... is over.
"Applicant?"
Answer me, Tyler.
What... ?
What are you talking about... ?
And, sometimes you control it...
The house is rented in your name.
What about Marla?
You... you can't be serious about this.
I'm not going...
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
If you know, I know.
Defuse the bomb?
Paraffin.
What?
What?
What?
What?
Abort the plan.
But, this is Project Mayhem.
No!
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
Too much school.
Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
Should we knock?
Taken care of.
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
Maybe.  What's this about?
What was the fight about?
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
I'm not following you --
Hold on.
I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
No, I'm good.
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
I know, honey.  I just --
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.
Nice try, kiddo.
"It?"
As in flannels and plaids?
Remember the gate number?
Thirty-nine.
Right. April 25th.
Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence.
No!
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "Stepmom."
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
That's what I'm here for.
You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.
Damn!  Leeches.
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a hand.
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
Why's that?
Where's his father?
Huntington Beach, California.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
You think you are... .
How?
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
Why me?
Not yet.
What's the plan?
He... took it.
That's a pretty hairy ride.  Full Colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing.
Can you walk?
Colonel.
You're not.
This just occurred to somebody, now?
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
<u>What</u>!
Okay.  ... I love you...
You still believe in God?
See, I told you!
No... it's just...
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
Tragedy?
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Venice...Like Katherine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME. . ....Why can't I be Katherine Hepburn...
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
Yes.  They're free.
What girl?  I didn't notice.
I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN!
<u>What</u>!?
They said you're The One.
I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
I know...
Well what am I gonna do with it?
No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
The Red Knight!
It's a classic.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Happily married, probably.
Sure...
<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
I don't drink coffee...
You have a disease.
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
Now, now.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
Well, is that a happy face I see?
Sure...
It brings out my eyes...
What?
You got any change?
It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
I didn't get it, did I?
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
Sort of.
Uhm hmm.
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
There's nothing to say, Tita...
My turn.
Yes, intentionally.
That's dangerous, you know.
Nothing.
I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?
Of course I'd like to.
What?! I can't hear you!
What?
Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
At game, Carl.
I don't think that's true.
I hope I didn't hear that.
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Don't call me "mack," honey.
Right, steam. A car you could ride around in and not cause a stink. But do you know, they will not even let us have it. Can you believe it? Why?! Man! He likes to create a stink. I wrote them a note once, and told them to clean it... I mean, don't you see that? It's just filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a stink! I don't even want to talk about it...
Yes.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Victor.
Victor.
Um. Yeah! Shorty!
What are you doin' here?
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Natasha, Maria, Tina-
C'mon.
I think she lives down by Pitt.
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
You gonna talk to him?
Yeah.
I'm a good friend of hers.
You gotta girLfrLend?
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
Sonofabitch.
You don't have to run with me, Crease.
Not luck. They don't want me.
Full name.
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
I don't know. I don't have any.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
Fletch...
You don't know me.
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
What?
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
Right.
It’s okay. The cops did it.
I know. I got bad luck or something.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
I have the same problem with my help.
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
Where am I going?
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
I'm sorry?
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
I love the outfits.
John Ultramalensky?
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Long story.
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true.
Act natural.
No.
You can't do that.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
Lock's busted.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
What?
Moved out.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
So let's go! We run the pictures.
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
You're onto something. That's good. What?
I have some ideas.
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
Not really.
John!
But I ain't got you...
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
Who's your decorator?
I have no answers.  Thanks for the stain.  Find the girl.  In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler.  We'll chat again, then.
Who?
Great pipes.
Right away!
Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
I like.
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
Johnny's C.D.?
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
How much?
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
No, wait...
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
There's that question...
Twelve pack?
I've got a clue.  Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.
I don't need it that bad.
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Okay.  'B-y-e!
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
Doyle.
What?
No - no.
Got a wife named Angie.
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de sérenité. Elle m'a demandé de tes nouvelles et si nous étions heureux.
Il est en retard.
What happens to the schedule?
Where from?
Why not?
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
Toy wit' this will ya.
Suspicion of what?
Makin' wine in the basement.  He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.
I can't.
Let yourself in.
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
Why is it called Hellgate?
What was it?
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
What I know is what I told you.
Yeah.
They around?
Where's the collar, in the cells?
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
You give him his drops?
I'm serious.
So am I.
I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
Frank...
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
How's that?
No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
I don't understand.
You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it.
She just died, your mother just died?
What kinda twisted animal.
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
All right, I'm with you.  I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
You really wanna know?
Johnny, I know, but...
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
What the hell is that smell?
I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.
How'd you know my name, mister?
Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
Yeah, that's right.
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
Chuck... look.
Your bed.
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
I don't know.
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
My whole world.
Stick around and you'll see.
Go out and plug the cord back in.
No way...  ...I wanna rock!
Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
It's just beginning.
I hope so.
Well, Nancy, I'm Paula... remember?  This is Sissy, and we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?...
Which is?
Yeah, we're here.
Will you listen, dammit!
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
Okay.
Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was like, having strippers delivered to church Bingos and shit.
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
Are you crazy?!
Okay.
I know what it sounds like.
She did!
My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit.  He might even pay some attention to me.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
But...wait a minute!
Don't be ridiculous!
Nothing.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts.
You're telling a lie.
I don't know what to say...
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
Is the ship going to sink??
But Rennie...
Very bad today.
What do I exude?
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
Then you should carry a gun.
No, we're not.
It's your best play, Nicky.
What?
She was very evasive.
What are you talking about?
Does what feel comfortable?
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
What about her?
About what?
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
Opening night?
I'm not sure.
I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
Who the hell cares?
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
I'm at the door.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand.
So what are you going to do about it?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
That's my cousin, Angelo.
But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
Sidney.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
Is it true?
Is what true?
I don't know.
No one's waiting.
Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
"Hell!"
I hope not.
Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
I've traveled so far -- and thought so much.  As you can see, my city was a sea city -- always filled with Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians.  The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami. It was Hindu of course but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped.
I --
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
No.
Well, that's one victory.
Thank you. No.
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail.
Have you found him?
There are a few million miles to go yet.
Who are you trying to convince?
Now is your chance to find out.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
I'll take care of it.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
No.  But one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
We don't have the manpower.
We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
This time I will supervise each test personally.
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
What are you talking about?
They found my eyelash.
Could be worse.  They could have found it in your eye.
I've got enough on my mind without that.
Good choice.
She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
Michael's.
I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
German, is that you?
I hope he's not just a body.
Were <i>you</i> alone?
They found an eyelash.
What exactly is wrong?
My medication.  I left it back there.
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
I can't do this.
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
I'm not doing it.
You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up.
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
I'll take care of my end.
That's right.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
I want to take a walk.
Assumed name... Houston.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
Whisky and a peach.
After four years and now the question comes up.
There are three men dead.
I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
You sent me to him.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
Sure...
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
So what?
Pull over.
We walk.
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
Yeah. I got out.
Suit yourself.
Two.
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
Just sandwiches...
He took the day off.
Just... tell us what you want.
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
I'll tell you when.
Nothing. What could I do?
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
'Good.'
What happened to this car?
What's it got to do with you?
This is my brother's car.
Oh ay?
Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming,  It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother?  I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back,  You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother,  One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs.  So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit,  So I'm worried. I can't fight them — I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead.
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
I don't know. That's all I was told.
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
Jack, you're wrong.
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
Who sent you, Thorpey?
Address?
Nicer than most.
Though nicer than most?
Sid Fletcher.
Oh, do you?
He was here for four days.
Could you please put my glass on the table?
Nasty.
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
What kind of entertaining?
Shouldn't think so.
Yeah.
Then he must have pulled her.
Oh, what you doing now?
No.
That's what I was wondering.
It just would. He was always the same.
Nobody seems to know.
Nowt.
It's not like that, luv.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
They came back?
Think about it.
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
Meaning what?
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
Sod off.
Yes.
Three hundred altogether?
Well, I think I had one once.
They came in and they, you know...
I...
It's not right.
Eh?
He is?
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
That's the truth...
You don't ax your sales force.
You...
You build it!
They...
When they...
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
Someone should stand up and strike back.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
You haven't talked to him.
Is that what I said?
Is that what I said?
He would take you on.  Yes.
Me?
Do you need five grand?
You need money?  Is that the...
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
No.
Where did Moss...?  I...
'Cause, you know, 'cause they weren't, I know that Mitch and Murray uh...
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
Moss...Who told him?
Would you excuse us, please.
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
...no...
...I only...
You're saying that I'm fucked.
Murray said...
I will close.
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
Now.  Yes...When?
Can't do it.
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
I have to go... 
You want something off the B list?
Somebody broke in.
Get 'em to me!
Did you tell 'em my sale?
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
Well, hadn't it?
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
What does that mean?
That's right.
They...
From the store.
Fuck her...
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
What is it?
Twelve-fifteen.
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
Yes.
What do I...?
Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
My wife...
Who did she call?
What would have elapsed?
When did you write the check?
I don't know.
The check wasn't cashed?
That...
I...
What...?
I don't have the power.  I said it.
She told me not to talk to you.
They took 'em...
And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
They got, listen to me...
Aren't you going out today?
If you don't want it, give it back.
Just a few days.
I can't.
I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
 What?  You read it in the papers?
This man informs to the police; this man allows his vengeance to be bought off... No, he is alone.
She couldn't decide.
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
Bought at the airport.
Merle, have you met my sister-in- law Deanna?
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
He will grow strong.
 My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
Me and you, great!  Gimme an hour to wash my face and do my research and we'll have these Washington suckers right where you want 'em.  Poor Frankie Five-Angels.  He always wanted to die in bed...with a broad.
It was hard to have him killed.
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
 And he agreed?
How long does this go on?
Kay... Kay...
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
He's not the same as when I met him.
I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.
Yeah, give me a minute.
Connie's outside.
Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
Mike, at three and a half...
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
No questions.
I'd like to go outside with him, in the open air.
Do you gamble?
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
Thanks...friend.
I don't think that's necessary.
The witness is excused; take him out.
Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
Who's asking?
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.
However I can help you...
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.
Very impressive.
I deny his every charge.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
We got friends in the commission.
Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
What a terrible misunderstanding. Of course, Signora Colombo can stay in the flat.  Who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal...when they pay such low rent.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
What're you talking about?
Tea is fine.
Why?
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
We have his note.
The honest sweat of one's brow.  I assure you I won't be offended. Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for two.
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
It's new.
But it's just my face you want to draw.
It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it?  You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you.
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
What?
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
I'm not, you know.
How long were you...?
Cut it out!
Oh no.  I never swim.
Not me.
Not fear.  More like disgust.
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
Clayton is fine.
If that's okay?
No.  The girl.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
There are straps in back.
Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
Oh, but you have.  You undressed for me.  I kissed you.  I even touched your prick.  How will you be able to live with yourself?
I think I'll hang around.
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
Then who did?
You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
A visitor.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
I don't mind.
You're serious.
Then the rumors are true?
I've changed my hair, you see. Since our last session.  Those old snaps look rather dowdy now.
The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
Fish.
I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
How ya doing?
I knew you'd say that.
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us...
How's that?
Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ...
You know my back.
Cadillac.
Double-meaning intended, right?
What for?
Not at all ...
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
Gray.
You know where the others are?
Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...
What does that mean -- ?
It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"
What are you doing back?
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
Damn crooks is everywhere --
I dunno ...
You, too
Yeah ...
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
I heard you were pumping gas -
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
Shadow games ...
After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
I'm cool.
I know. I've missed you, too
Toby...
Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
Buy you a drink?
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
Deodorant.
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
"Unlock my button" ... ?
Woo-woo-wooooo!
Of course you are. You're a professional...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
What about The Club ... ?
Let me worry about The Club ...
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
Bench seats.
Tell me...
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
So what's in there -- ?
How come ... ?
You sure I can't go with ya?
Look at Jeannie's kid.
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
No more shines, Billy.
No. No. The guy from downtown.
Why would I get into that?
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
It'll be okay.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
I gotta talk to you.
How?
Yeah.
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
Done.
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
I hate to do dishes.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
We'll pick it up.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
Yeah.
--or a tail--
No one. I didn't have the number.
I don't know.
Gone.
Some shows are worth the price of admission, partner.
No, I had to talk him down.
This is your house, right?
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
I don't have a VCR at my house.
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
What is it?
Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Well... I'll be speaking to your supervisor.
Okay. How?
--Half-red, half-black--
I don't know what it's called.
I'm pretty sure it's right.
Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week.
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
Bullshit.
I did.
I've been busy.
Why me?
Five.
You too, Gerry.
I live right around the corner.
I been here a couple years.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
Oh, come on, Sean--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
Who is he?
So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai engine under there? Can I make it back to my house?
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
Like what, Will?
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
What?
That must have taken you a long time.
This is a real piece of shit.
Tell me what you really think.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
You've never been out of Boston.
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
No, I don't.
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
Define that.
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
Look at me. What do you want to do?
Do you want to talk about it?
Only if you grab my ass.
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
Then why don't we just get it out of the way.
How was that?
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
No.
Like me?
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
How do you know that?
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
Joe!
Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? 
Be glad to get my han' on some cotton. That's the kin' a pickin' I understan'.
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
Oh.
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
Gallon or two?
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
What'd he look like again?
I didn't see nothin'.
Why, I guess so.
But--but how we gonna eat?
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
Excuse me for asking.
They never wrote you nothing?
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
Hide in the willows. If it's awright to come back I'll give you four high whistles.
I aim to.
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
Lookin' for a job?
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
Sure. We aim to.
You mean I can't even get outa here?
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Forget it, Ma. Jus' think about the nice things out there. Think about them grapes and oranges--an' ever'body got work--
Ya say we're acrost?
Since before they stopped us las' night.
Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
They come. They come and pushed me off.
You're *trespassin'*! It ain't you lan' no more! An' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun!
Ain't no whisky, is they?
I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
Man bones?
It's them white things, made outa dish-stuff, like in the catalogues!
Won't they ketch us?
Please don't.
I won't--  --if you won't tell what *I* done!
Now don't you go monk'ing--
I never--
In the corporate offices.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
What?
What do you want to do?
Insane.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
Yes.
Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
It's always the little things.
As long as I get the laugh.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
What?
That's probably a good idea.
What if I come back?
That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
Other people can't.
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
Tell me about your vision of the reunion.
What stuff?
Do you like the people you work with?
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
Is that right?
Excellent. Here they come.
Yup.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be so easy.
I've looked at it.
Jim?
Yeah. I guess we did.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
How did you get this job?
Wow.
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
All by yourself?
Doesn't matter.
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
You too.
Need a lift?
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
Yeah.
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
Five years. My son was born here.
How did you find out all that?
I can't do this. I can't leave you...
I brought it to you in the hospital.
No, you didn't.
Doesn't matter.
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Whatever you want.
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
Why? There's no food in the house?
What are you talking about?
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
Tch. What are you --
Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
Why?!
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
Well, it's good that you're there.
Okay.
I know. We miss you too.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
What do you mean?
I don't understa-
Well, I know Peterson's. Old place is as good as falling down around your ears.
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
No reason you should, no reason you should.
I was there for that shot, actually.
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
They fired you?
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Weekend after next...
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
You know her?
We should be fine, then.
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
Have you talked to Tom about it?
I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
I want to watch.
I just could never say it!
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
I'm okay... I'm okay.
What stuff is that?
Well, if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts.  That's the whole lesson right there. You have a good day now... Just... keep on freeing yourself up.
Alright sir.
Hackers of the World, Unite!
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
What is it with this guy?
Was that her top?
The sensitive type.
Again?  Yeah sure.
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
Yeah? Display?
Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday.
Up all night again, huh?
And unpack.
Thank you!
Burn!
Think you can do better?
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
Are you challenging me?
Uh, hold on...
It's my subway defense system.
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
Thanks for your help.
212-555-4240.
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
D'you bring those Crayola books?
Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that order, necessarily, right?
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
Excuse me?
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Sh, sh sh sh sh.
Congratulations.
So, we get the mother, we get the boy.
Real charmer.
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
I don't know Brady.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
What's going on?
She's not dead!
No. You son of a bitch!
Get up there Rachel!
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
Because the lights are all out.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
Drive Carefully.
Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
I can't sleep.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
It's Halloween. I mean don't you want to get dresses up in a really scary costume and get some candy?
You ready for some Ice Cream?
Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?
No.
I don't know.
Okay, bye.
Do you?
You look sharp. You understand?
If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors.
Least I'm not alone.
Be here in a minute.
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
What?
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Okay. Bye.
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
I can't. What if it's the Wallaces!? We'd get Annie in trouble.
Lee Brackett.
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
What did he look like?
The bogyman!
I'm scared...
No! Do as I say.
I've given them his profile.
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
I can't believe it!
Uh...
And you, you-you're going?
But I'm seeing him.
Hmm?
They fit right in together.  And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...
And it ruins everything else.
It does.
Yes.
Oh, uh, about a month ago.  Wha- what do I have?
Hi.
Ed Smythe, yes.
Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty? 
What are you doing here?
How about you?
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
No?
Uh, yes!
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
Bye.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
I have been in love with you for so long.
But not over me?
Poor Hannah.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
I know.
Mmm.
Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
Like-- 
It was on your shirt!
I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
No, I'm not dying now, but, but  you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right.  And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay.  I'm not going to go tomorrow.  But eventually, I'm going to be in that position.
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
I know, I know, and your hamster.
I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
What are you talking about?
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
...from Mavis, also.
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Now, Holly's not shy.
Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
Yeah, can you believe it?
Uh-huh.
Well-well, like what?
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
Well--
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
I recall you.
Yeah.
I'm fine.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
People change...you know.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Well, what about me?
Oh!
It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I care.  You used to be so ambitious and...  God, you really liked it?!
Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
Yeah.
Hi.  How you doin'?
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
And?
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
Say it in English.
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
Rich, comic book freaks.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
You're ready now.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
And who is "they?"
How <u>crazy</u> is that....
M'I gonna see you tonight?
That's right.
What's new onna street?

What reaction?
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.

For a consideration.
Starling...?
...what's he got against you?
I don't <u>think</u> so...
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
...how so?
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
The commissioner is going round the Cafe...
Take mine.  Ah. And is that your <u>wife</u>...  Signora.  Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
No. 
Yes.... yes...
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
Spoken like a Protestant.
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
...you have to <u>eat</u>...
It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
Explain in depth the plan we have for him.  Until tomorrow.
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
I don't understand.
...what do you expect me to...
Because...?

I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
....that's right.
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
Welcome to the human race.  Do you know, there are people who admire you?  Reasonable people.  Why don't you <u>find</u> them...?
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.

I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
Wha-at?  What is it?
You guys have been so colossal...
Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.  Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?
Don't worry, I have 33 more days to find just the perfect moment to tell him how I...
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
Yeah. And?
It's just funny...who needs a serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw when we have ourselves.
We need more ritalin. Can't we just grind it into the munchkins' food?
I gotta...I gotta go do a "bunk check." Or some fucking thing.
That's not what I was worried about.
Talia's a rock. She'll be fine...

No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her!  What are you smiling at?
Oh yeah, that's it.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
I'll think about it.
Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
Sure.
If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
You're not funny.
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
You kids are making too much damn noise.
"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
Let's kick his ass.
Punch it in!
This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
Thought I'd have a go at building the birdhouse on Saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand?
Have a nice outing, you lot.
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
steps back.
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
Mummy!
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
This . . .
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
Let's go overseas . . .
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Yes . . .
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
Second most common?
Skin cancer.
You just made that up.
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Gwen.
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
What's the occasion?
Where's Allison?
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
This isn't happening.
Never to put you in my will.
Really? Why?
Where's my wife?
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
Hey buddy!
We're just gonna take some blood here.
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
I know a guy who only has one leg.
The bathroom!  For two days?
I got your bail continued.
He gives a good report and I walk?
How recently?
It's November.
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
Mister LaPlante...
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
I...
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and... and he... saved my... life. Off the record.  Was it you?  Why would you deny it if it was? Because you took my purse?  Why?
Were you in it?  In the war?
Uh, actually... yes... I... should never have come forward and presented myself as --
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
We paid him a million dollars. You'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings.
I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
That would be stupid.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
You must value your independence.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
A man scared me.
It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
What's that?
There's no card or anything.
How long does it have to be a new house?
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
Philip!  The senior partner?
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
I think it's time I came home now.
Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
Put it out, man!
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
I didn't.
Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
No.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
What is it?
Why?
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
Lieutenant.
Congratulations.
Central Park.
Aye.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
The only thing you can do.  You must end it.
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
I cannot explain.
Aye.
Then take me with you.
Are you a cop?
What do you want?
You got me.
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
About what?
Sorry.
I know.
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
You don't really believe this do you?
So?
Must you fight him?
Get out.
What?  How?
I like my work.
We'll see.
This cannot be.
Why did you wait?
Me too.
Yes.
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
I can take care of myself.
I think he's dead!
The mother is in Florida visiting her sister.  The father works at home, so he's probably inside.
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
He knows better than that.
I guess not.
No way.  I tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there.
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
What if he's dead?  What if you killed him?
We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one.
It's about Mars --
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
They're fine.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Use more ice.
We don't have time!
Keeps to himself, more like.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
Close.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
I still see that boy's eyes.
That big asshole nailed my windows.
Better than you getting killed!  Don't touch that gun!  Daddy says --
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
What are we going to do about Mike?
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.
That's why you get the big bucks, Captain.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree?
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Okay.
Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
A delegation.
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
Name a price.
And four children?
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
Have you requested re-enforcements?
What was the response?
Will you protect us.
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.
What did you overhear?
Satellites?
'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said.  I thought I'd better tell you.
“Well rewarded” Those were his words.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
I committed no war crimes.
No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul.
) You cannot kill them all.
We’re not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules.
Very soon.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
Call, sir?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
One thousand francs.
I need a great favor.
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
Your brother's here?
Let's have dinner first.
Jean Baptiste!
Murdered! By whom?
Give him time.
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
In Ruhengeri?
What sort of car?
What does it matter.
I want to know.
No.
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines is a very important property for Sabena. Our directors believe we should close down, shutter the place until this unrest is over?
When?
Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
No, I don't want you going on the street.
Who is this Simon?
Can I help you?
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
Not at all!
I'm moved beyond words.
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
I don't know!!
And I think that's case --
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
Take the gun.
And then where are we?
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
For chrissake give me a hand!
It's succeeding!
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
Then who are they?
You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
You know everything you do gets me hot.
Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
Where is she?
Asking the wrong person again.
Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
-- what...are...you...going...to --
-- wit...nesses --
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
-- even if I give you a million as well?
I remember...it was a long time ago...my father said: when the House was finally completed, make sure...we-christen-it- with-this-bottle-of-dirt-cheap-champagne- that-should-still-be-in a cupboard somewhere!
I am.
-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
I think I'll do what I damn well please.
-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
-- confirming everything we already know --
Then who did??
Believe me, we need to.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
Something....happened --
What was her name?
We don't have proof of that.
The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
A few years older, perhaps.
How's your arm?
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
I'm scared!
We're going to go someplace new.
What about all my other stuff?
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
My God, I heard something!
Good night daddy.
Well something just happened to the power upstairs... Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event -
Well what do you think it is?
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
Who?
A friend?
What are you talking about?
I'm all right...
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
White meat will be fine...
Oh, that's nice...
Good night.
We'll be there.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
Runic?
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
Doc?  ...  Doc ... Hello?
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
Taken what?
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
Sure.  Why?
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
Unh-unh.
Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
No!  No.  It's not the same ... I ... No.  What you did ... it was ... evil.
But how in God's name ...
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
My next word was gonna be "consciousness."  Swear to God... tubby.
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we send the thank you note to?
Yes way.
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
Yeah.  The big E.
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
The C.I. what?  God, no...
This is too bad to be false.
Trust Leonardo....
Wha -- you don't want to know...
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
Tonight?  You're whacked.  The timing's off, I'm underequipped Damnit, I have a date!
To what do I owe the dishonor of a reunion, you centrally intelligent scumsicle.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
Why George, you big softie...
The Dancing Dingus!
With a little jazz.
The Hipster!
The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
The Hudsucker Hoop!
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
I'm plenty happy!
On Norville Barnes!
Why yes, do you know it?
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
I'm sure I --
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
Let me look.
Every year?
Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
Hey! Where's that martini?!
Phony, huh?
Sez who?
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Terrific.
Nooo, I don't guess you will be.
...It is?
But, Buzz, you know I never --
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Yessir.
Well, why don't ya read it.
-- tough titty toenails!
Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I was in bed for a week! Positively sick with fury! I called in the gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee!
I --
You're fired.
Oh my God, sir!
-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --
The mark notices.
Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
Yes -- on the boat.
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
My brother's wife.
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
One of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  "You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica?  You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?"  What he could do to that word "beautiful." That's Paul's great weapon -- words.  He uses them the way other men use their fists.
But she's not dead, Wes.
Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Why should you be?  My wife is a mental case.  Please keep that in mind, Miss Connell -- particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about Zombies.
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
I'm afraid the decanter will have to stay where it is.  I engaged you, Miss Connell, to take care of my wife, not my brother.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it.
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
Technical responsibility, real responsibility -- what difference does it make?  Jessica lives -- or she dies. That's what we're talking about!
In other words, I'm on trial.
Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
And as usual no one believed me...
I wasn't star--
So early?
That shirt?
Yeah, that one.
That one.
Don't be dim.
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
Hnnn.
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
What you been up to?
I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
I mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off Janey and Jim, you watch. It's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess...
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
Oh Wendy.
Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
Of course.
You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
No need to make excuses --
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.
Um, Libbets Casey.
You going to tell dad?
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
Tell Sandy? What?
I don't know.
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Hey Sandy.
All my model planes.
Yeah.
Are you his girlfriend?
Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
I had him!
Actually...
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
Like I said, no.  We know about those things up here.
I told her to come.
I beeped you over two hours ago.
What happened at that signing?
Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
That's right.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
You know I remember that.
There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep.
I told you I don't remember.
That's a long time.
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
Who?
There's nothing more to talk about.
But we work so well together...
Don't you pull that shit with me.
You're not following procedure.
Drop the gun, Walter.
What are we?
Nothing if not vampires...
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
Knew? You mean he is...
Then blame the one who made her...
You let them do it.
No.
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
Stop her Louis!
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
Don't mock, Claudia...
Not yet.
But how will I ever know, Louis?
They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
Give it to me!!!
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
I can't do it.
Dying?
I want a woman.
Do you think so?
We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
Paris? You came from Paris?
Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
It's just a room...
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
Yes...
Yes!
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
Is that bad?
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
No, I'm the King of the World.
Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
You're okay. Thank god.
Is he?
Why are you being like this?
I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
This weekend?
Ben Willis.
I'm sorry.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
To get out of Southport?
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
He's in it with Willis?
I guess so.
Rio, baby!
Why?
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
I'll go find him.
You collect these to sell, abroad?
In case you do so, would you --
Well ——
May life be good to you both. As for the others —— they will be quiet here —— and I will be with them.
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
I'm afraid so. There were rumors ——people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
Maybe you're right. Help me get something to carry her downstairs.
Sleep well.
Closer and closer —- until they bite into your throat!
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
They shall not hurt you
But one must love a father.
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints —— the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
I don't understand you.
Her name is Thea?
Miss Wollsten -— my secretary, she'd know.
Why -- no not before Thea came ——
But that should make you like her.
We have no time for that.
The General threatened me.
It is for that he hates me.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars.
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You . . .  . . . wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea.  What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right.  You've got your wish. You've never been born.
It isn't me!
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
Zuzu's petals.
George Bailey.
That's the kid.
Yes, but George . . .
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
I know. I know.
Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years.
Mother? What do you want?
Nice girl, Mary.
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Uh-huh.
No.
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
Oh . . .
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Do me a favor, will you, George?
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Yeah –– yeah . . . sure I will.
Right down here.
That way, huh?
This way.
You like it? I'll send you a box.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
I'll take chocolate.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
You may kiss my hand.
I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
Tuesday.
Please, let's not stop, George.
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
You forgot something.
But of course.
Back down!
What the hell.  Did your mom put all this together?
Over here!
Aren't you off-duty?
If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation.
In here.
Please.  It's my job.
Hey -- you can't do that.
Got it.
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
You said something about a camera.
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
Do you?
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
Fooling around?
Good.
For me?
Damn.
Do you?
Because of today?  The beach?
I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Mike's out there.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Did he raise the Kids?
When?
Shouldn't he be at home?
Hiya yourself.
I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's okay....
That's you.
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
Hang on, hang on...Okay, go.
Help!  Help!
Okay, okay, coming....
What the hell is it?
You going with Patrick?
Maybe.
I want to go with you!
He thought he had a good reason.
So?  So?
I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
Sure am.
How many sharks have you killed?
Me?  I don't know.  Twenty, thirty.  I love them, think they're the greatest.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
And what else is bothering you?
Not enough loving.
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Here.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
It's my new perfume.  Great White, the Man-Eater.
Sure.  Let's go.
I have to get out of here.
I don't understand.
You wanted to know about a cave?
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
... Okay.
But you --
Only to myself.
I'm  fine.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
Let's hope he knows that.
Believe me, I am.
How'd it get in here?!
I know.
And big for his age.
Thanks.
'Course they're also so rich.
How long you staying?
I'm a water-skier.
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
Yes, it's great!
Can hardly wait to do it again.
He's diving!
I thought I was your boyfriend.
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
It's disappeared.
Aww, can't I keep it?
I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
I'll be right there.
I don't know...You...I don't know.
Then don't come any closer.
They're at the beach....
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
I'd be afraid of losing....
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
Can't help myself....
Let me finish dinner before you eat it...Chop the peppers....
I won't....
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
You're all I have left...I don't want you going in the water....
I have to get this finished.
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be....
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
You must get bored easily.
Doesn't matter....
It's wonderful....
I'm terrific... Come on....
A big one....
A big one....
I have my own little island.
I like to travel....
I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
Inch by inch....
She's a tough lady....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
Put me down, damnit....
They put bombs on dolphins....
What?
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
Maybe it's gone....
Stop that!
You jump, you'll kill yourself....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
Jake.
I'll take care of it.
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
No you don't. That's how you <u>think</u> you feel about him. That's how you feel about <u>yourself</u>. You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for <u>you</u>.
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
Listen to me saying what?
We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is "Jennifer <u>Eight</u>."
What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
You looked like you did?
You're a fucking great policeman, but give yourself a break. You're here 5 minutes, you find yourself a fucking homicide? .. Not many people could do that in a place like this .. And you gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky areas in this case? .. I mean, stop me if I'm going up the wrong nostril ..
You don't really believe this?
I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
I'm going up to the institute.
Hey ..
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
And did they?
Coz I'm <u>short of men</u> & Ang- elo won't do it .. Who ever I got free first - <u>you</u> <u>get</u> ..
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
Cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate. He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one.
Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.
He ain't offerin me shit.
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
No.
Do you pray?
Have you known her long?
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
No .. not now ..
<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
Why?
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
Well, no you didn't --
I have to finish my job --
I think you added the "brutal."
You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Oh come on --
They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
My son... my mind...
And have fun at your bachelor party.
-- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" --
We are?
Yeah, thanks.
No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
Let's not tell our sad stories.
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
You want...
I don't know --
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
At eleven at night? _ 70.
It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
I'll give it everything.
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
Here it is.  "Show me the money."  Show.  Me.  The.  Money. _ 36.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Let's do it again.
I might call you later!
Good deal, man.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
Damn right.
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
Why not --
To the pools?
Oh no -- _ 14.
I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
My husband believes in you.  We're gonna make it.  Bye bye Dorothy.
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
Pleasure.
Dick.
You'll lose.
Hi Ray.
Can you be quiet?
What is it?
Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
Nothing you haven't seen before.
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
I would completely support that.
Here!
What about Eric?
Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
Not if it can't dig.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
Then we go home?
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
On the side of that one truck.
You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
To collect my fee.
You version of it.
I lost everything I came after on this trip, but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11.
She's nuts.
I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
It has a broken leg!
She's with Sarah!
For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at this!  You could-
I have to find Kelly!
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
JUMP!
Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
Oh my God.
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
Anything else, you old fossil?
It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!
Dilophosaurus.
Why not?
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Yeah.
He sends his apologies.
Yeah.
I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
I doubt it.
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
Why?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you two, uh - - are?  I wish you the best luck.
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
Dorkatops!
Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
Timmy!  Do as he says!  Timmy!  Do as Dr. Grant says, quick!
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
Thanks, Dad.
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
Really? How much?
No, but...
That's not true...
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
Jason's. It came out of his chest... a hand with long blades on the fingers...
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
No. You've told me all I need to know.
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
There's a pizza place over on Market.
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
Uh-huh...
Yeah, what is it?
You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
Just what you've published.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
A true friend would do it.
Did you see him?
Yes.
Why would you suppose so?
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.
I've heard of it happening.
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
We know that.
-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
It's a farce.
Close only by virtue of antithesis.
It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
Lying in the gutter where they belong.
I'm not obliged to give you access, you know -- not without authorization -- but I'll make an exception this one time.
Yes.  Isn't it there?
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
Orlac is an account?
It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
Now Ann ...
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game - two men have already died!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
Oh my God ... Ann?
What was it, Jack?
What's compassion, mister.
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
I do not love him.
Sorry. 
Yes indeed.
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
I guess he figured it was better.
Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
Most of them.
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
-- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things --
-- OK?
No.
And I don't think that was Tom.
You said it was!
No, I said what did you think.
Yeah, you got to me.
It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
Mm.
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
My bed.
Yeah.
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints.  Can I go in? I need some stuff.
With Trina.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
You're going back?
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
I wanted to give it to you first.
I've just got a few --
Two years ago? Sorry.
Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
Has she talked with you since prison?
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Then how are you involved?
We grew up together. Kids.
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Good.  I'll see him in there.
Not particularly.
Detroit.
Playing.
Show.
Soon.  Very soon.
Will she pick me up after school?
What if she forgets?
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
That's okay...
No.  This is fine.  Just take a bite, you'll like it fine.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
I'm sorry...
Good night.
No, she never did.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.
Was there Burger King?
No, son, I didn't get fired.  I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little T.V. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. Just you and me...How 'bout that?
Like a principal?
Thank you.  I have no further questions.
No.
No.
I suppose...
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
That represents a gross billing in excess of two million--  What?!
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
What?
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.
Ted, do you love him?
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
Kramer...
What?!?
I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Fine.
What if I fight it?
Don't worry.  I'll get the money.
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
No cried?
It is alright, Father.
Are you? Of whom?
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
Here. We'll collect them.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa. When you return.
Did you receive the letter?
All?
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
Not until you are eighteen.
It is an island. American territory.
I do not know, Holiness.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
Where is that?
In the Americas.
And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
The people will not allow it.
Please, come in, so cold.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
You decide.
As you say.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
I would not know. Maybe.
The Chinese.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
Oh yes.  I killed him.
Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.
And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
Everybody out, back to your tents, <u>now</u>!
Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
I don't know!
Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
Thank you, Jack.
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
Scales were oval.  It was an <u>Asian</u> crocodile.
Nothing's real.
Oh, bullshit.
Guess I finally got bit.
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
Excuse me?
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
I didn't say it like that.
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
Really--
Look.
Alright, Jack!
He looks like a giant tea bag.
He heeds a tourniquet.
No.
Probably not.
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
I'll take it!
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
What is this?
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
Look.
That it's about to go wrong.
I don't know.  Back the truck--
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
This is what we do?
<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
Kelly--
Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object.
Well, except for the one girl.
The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
Hot damn, Clarice.
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
Good idea.
Yes sir.
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Miggs has been murdered.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
They weren't there. Get close-ups.
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
I think so.
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
No. You ate yours.
Reasonably so. Yes.
Mmm. And what else...?
Was it a butterfly?
A moth... How did you predict that?
On what basis would they reject him?
No. We just -
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
Early. Still dark.
Yes...
You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
Alice?
"Some"?
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
We don't.
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
Will you men help us stop the French?
What else?
You forget yourself!
Thank you. How can I reward you?
Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them. They keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range, so when they're close enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. They look to be three hundred yards out.  Bloody murderers.  You have three days.
Fire!
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
Le mot d'ordre?
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
Intelligence may not be the right word...
I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
No.
What?
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
How much time does that give us?
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
Not yet.
What about his suit?  That's a million five the company's got to replace.  They'll make somebody go get it.
Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
What was it?
It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
Two hundred meters.
Like a leech.
Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
I ought to smack your face!
DeJesus...It's got him.
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
The air's stopped.
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Hardly.
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
Seven hundred for the pair.
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
Yeah, but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar.
I'll think of something, don't worry.
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
Fucking Northern monkeys.
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
Just carrying a bag.
Well, put your seatbelt on then.
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
But...  Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle; they're gutless faggots.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
There is only three of us here.
There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.
I mean it's fucking empty.
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
What do you mean, me?
We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
It's pay day, ain't it?
I want your bar.
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
At what, exactly?
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
Well, excuse me, brother, mother or any other sucker, doesn't make any difference, they are still fucking guns, and they still fire fucking bullets!
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
Six.
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
What do you mean?
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
It's pathetic. You can't be desperately in love when you're 14 years old.
I can't take any more school.
And what did she do?
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
Nice job.
That badge--
A .45--
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
Suppose not.
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
Dad, can I talk to you about track?
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
Tanks, huh?
So you're going into the Army?
Made some money, came back here--
Something like that.
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
Right.
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
Mikey--
We been through this before--
You know who it was they dug up?
Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
Because I'm your father.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
Bandidos, Injuns--
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
And the Sheriff at the time was Big Charley Wade. Charley was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county.
--Santiago.
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
He still living?
I got an idea what happened.
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
And the ten thousand?
The Perdido thing?
How come you never got married again?
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
You had to deal with him in running the club.
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
He squeezed money out of you?
No. Is he sick?
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
And when my father was Sheriff?
For a while.
Different charge. I had a still. Made my own mescal.
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
People liked him.
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
You'd do a good job.
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
I haven't seen anybody come by.
The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella--
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
He doesn't need to know all my business.
You ever been married?
Why?
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
That's so cool.
It's an illusion.
I could scoop them out.
I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
Maybe he'll show you.
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
You didn't marry him for love.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
Are you sure?
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
... they believe you.
After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones.
What about Swann's miracles?
Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
Mr. D'Amour?
It's one in the afternoon.
Then what do you want?
You know of him?
I saw him in Vegas once.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
Probably.
I don't think the dead much care.
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
Yes.
Shit...
And what does Jennifer think's real?
Yeah.  You could say that.
Yes...
What?
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
For an introduction.
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
Is that all?
And he didn't have them?
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Yes.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
You didn't try hard enough.
And he's dead?
Why would I want to?
The woman has a new love in her life.  Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
Oh.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Not really. How long are you here for?
No way.
Ok.
Charlotte, who?
I don't know.
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
Yeah? But look at you.
That's ok.
We established that we have no communication.
Oh.
That's too scary.
Where'd you grow up?
Fuck off.
We should get you to the doctor.
Tomorrow.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Yes.
Uh, no.
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Yeah.
When are you coming home?
One moment, please.
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
No!  Hi! So great to meet you!
You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight.  Quarks and dark matter, things like that.  Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?
What happened?
I can't believe Will killed him.
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
Something he said, just before...
Just open the door, please.
You just call?
Yes... and you are?
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
Thank you.  Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
And also that...
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
You should think about getting professional help.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
Yes.
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
What's the bible for?
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
What are these?
Sure.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
You are the younger of two...
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
What do you mean by that?
Are you saying he's legally sane?
And what about you?  What about Peter Kelson?  Where is your moral compass?
Of course.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
How're you doin' today?
You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
Don't curse.
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
No I don't.
That's not it.
What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
Camille, she'll be fine.
You're a caterer?
Oh, sorry.
Huh?
I mean, I'm having a good time with you...
Then I'll get you some punch.
It's okay.
Four days.
I found you someone.
Mom tell you to do this?
This brother from my college.
How'd you get him to say yes?
I told him you looked like me.
Oh, great.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
I wouldn't know.
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
I just can.
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
Big-ass titties?
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
I don't.
Your hot-ass temper.
I don't.
Fine, Quincy.
So you're gonna act salty all night?
I wanted you to.
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
Not really.
You weren't at my game.
We're going to get some food.
Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
Yup.
What are the doctors saying?
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Cause I don't get it.
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
Hey.
What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
At one in the morning?
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
Sorry.  You okay?
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
I just told you.
We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
I don't know.
What's wrong?
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
That's great, thank you.
It's not -- what's a 422?
If you're not here for a 422 --
yeah, good, ok.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
Well...is that illegal?
Really?
Yeah.
Billingsley's?
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
I lost my gun.
That was so great what you just said.
Claudia.
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
This sounds threatening.
Do you have love in your heart?
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
What?
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
Yes I do.
It's...doesn't matter....
Yeah.
Where is he?
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
What am I doing?
...this close...
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
Oh yeah.
...just wait...Dad...you want something...can you say...
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
No.  I said that.
I preffer to stand.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
I didn't hear anything.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
THAT'S NOT MINE.
Did your wife find out?
Yeah. Yes.
Well can you do me one favor and don't do that.
You want her right now?
Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere.
Do you love me, Rose?
I'm a bad person.
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
No one else that I know?
How long with Ellen?
Two years...three years...
Maybe...I don't...
...I don't know...
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
I don't know what I've done.
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
What does that mean?
You need to sober up.
Linda --
I have to go.
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
...I don't....
Thank you.
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
That's pretty cool.
-- the fuck are you talking about?
We need more dog food --
hang in there, ok. I love you.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
I understand you saved my son's life today.
And you were not hurt?
M'lady...?
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
Nothing... Nothing.
Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
I am preparing for a ball!
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
Come, we have a boat waiting.
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
But -- what is he doing?
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
What you're asking is impossible!
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
Pull them back!
Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now!
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
The Queen Mother.  Anne.
Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even talk about it.
It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
Get out of my way.
The King killed my son!
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
She will be at the ball.
How did you --
If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?
Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
My dear, I've already done it.
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
Yeah?
That's the point.  He slipped up, and he's desperate now.  And that means he's all the more dangerous.
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
You mean shut your ass down!
We're by Ozone...
Alright, stay on the phone.
Fine...
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
And who are you?
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
Who is it?
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
No -
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
Let's see what we got...
How about Marvosa and the others?
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
Shit, we just started.  But I better log out of this.
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Did you have sex with her?
County jail - get in.
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
Not the Bible?
Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
Get him to Atlanta.
You said the guy down here is good.
I know...
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
To recover the mind set.
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
There's no connection between the families.
What?
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.
Will. Get right back here. He just called.
Tonic will be fine.
Yes, are you okay...?!
I'll get my purse.
Are you okay...?
I'll see you later. All right?
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
You'll let me go now?
Dr. Chilton.
Uh... sure...
Linda doesn't come in nights.
Atlanta and Birmingham.
Why do you think I called?
He's right-handed.
Cut the general crap.
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
I remember.
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
No.
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
Come home with me.
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick...
You got a deal...
Thanks.
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
We don't know that.
How did it happen?
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
You went in the apartment?
And Hobbs died?
...yes.
I keep getting it for Christmas.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
You had disadvantages.
That's interesting.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
May I keep the file?
Why does it feel good?
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
Kevlar Second Chance.
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
But wasn't it funny?
"Funny"?  I dunno.  But "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure.  Like, that moment, when you both came onstage...
He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings.
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
Okay.  You're probably right.
You're not listening to me --
DON'T TOUCH ME!
And you're just poor white trash!
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
I'll take my chances!!
Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
Bob, Andy needs to RELAX.  See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special.  Something nice...
I used to think you were original.
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
Bob Gorsky.
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
It's already begun.
We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
No!
The Matrix?  Yeah.
How?
Yes.
Go.
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
They'll be able to track it.
We have no choice.
Who's coming for me?
What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
Yes.  A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age.  I say almost funny.
What -- what lesson?
How?
I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.  Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air.  Yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world.  Because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
What's going on?
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
She would say she knows enough.
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
That I would find the One.
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
What?
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
My name is Trinity.
What?
Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
We have to!
What choice?
What?
Because...
You will tonight.  I guarantee it. I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.
Zion?
Where is it?
Hell yes!
Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
He's alive.
Got it.
I don't know.  I lost him.
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
Ok.  Wait here.
Uh...can we give you a check?
Jewish...
Yeah.
And say what?
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
Don't be smart.
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
I know.
Hostess?
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
Ok.
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
"Francis Macomber."
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
I don't mind.
No.
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
 Shut up.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
Quiet please.
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
Who's Annie?
They respect you.  Isn't that a kind of love?
I wasn't going to say --
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
You mean this, sir?
I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?
Right away.
Drew, you're out of line.
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
I didn't say.
Hot or cold.
"Death and Taxes"?
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
Uh -- he's from out of town --
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
I thought this was practically a done deal --
I don't care.
With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
What you then?
Doctor lady make it irey.
Mine, too.
She knows you real self?
Sure.
Nothing?
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
What?
On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one.
You're welcome.
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
I haven't.
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
No.
It was everything.
I loved it.
And you can't tell me who you are.
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
Thank you for loving me.
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
Closer than that.
Good night to you, Bill.
A 'deal'?
How about giving a guy a break?
There's one to every rule.
What's it like where I'm going?
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.
Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.
Absolutely.
I don't know.
You tell me, Bill.
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
I'll be the judge of that.
Yes?
What are you saying, that it's time to go?
You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it.  And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death.
I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
I'll take it from here --  I am --
Of course.
I didn't ask any question.
I don't!
What the hell are you talking about?
Watch it!
Thank you, Quince.
It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
Sir, I'll deliver the package.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.
Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
How did you know?
Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's get this day started.
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
I don't understand.
I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
Yes, but --
That's why it's okay.
Oh, yes --
The fireworks are about to start.
Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
That's it.
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
Quiet!
You told me.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
Tell me about her again.
I wasn't helping you for money.
You know what we have in common?
Yes.
There are things you know for sure.
Just relax.
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
And what did he say?
My wife used to call me Lenny.
No!
What's this all about?
Don't protect him.
What?
Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  * that and order a beer.						  *
How do you know about me?
Did Teddy send you?
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
Who?
You're living.
You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
Natalie who?
Why are you following me?
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
Why not?
Wouldn't be appropriate.						*
There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
What the fuck are you talking about?
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.
We're not certain!
I got to talk to my ADO...
No, you don't, Jim.  'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be?
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
I'm a fiend for mojitas.
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
She's dead...
Died in childbirth, having me...
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Good samba dancing...?
Hola, viejo.
Of course.
And what do I do with him?
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow...
So we want to change-up the mission statement.
I would never doubt you.
What's the point?  It's going down.
We don't know.
I have faith.  In horoscopes and fortune cookies...
Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
Alonzo...!
How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny, I gotta go...!
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
You sure?
"Salutations from the south..."
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
Define small.
What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y.
You gonna beat me, Joe?
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
Don't say nothing about you either.
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Uh, yessir.
Ready for anything.
Gonna be like money from home.
Get down -- where?
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Ziat!
The Hilton.
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Something like that. Cigarette?
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
Twelve years.
Thank you.
What do you mean?
Section 13?
Yeah!
Jimmy?
What?
Oh shit.
For Christ's sake, just GET on the plane, okay!
Who?
Oh Yesil...  Yesil's his name but I...don't know anything... 'bout...Yesil...
Take a look.
Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
Depends.  You got a memo?
Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
Nino, please...
What?
You know what I mean...
I was just late.
Just do it!!
Try not to sweat?
Ah...
I know.  Help me get a sample.
You got a point there...
But you didn't even taste your cocoa.
They're called Novril--they're for your pain. 
Oh, like I could do that?
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
The profanity bothers you?
She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me.
Then who did?
Perfect.
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
Show me the way?
As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.
Great.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
No, just the paper will be fine.
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
It'll only take a second.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. Think of me as your inspiration.
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
I'm telling you, I can't.
Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
Well, it certainly says you.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
There's that spice again.
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
Maybe you can, Libby.
So do I...
If I can.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Did they win?
Here it is.  Very first copy.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..
On what.
Magic...
I suppose I did.
Lovely.
Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
It's that time.  Go.
Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
- this is very disconerting..
Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer.  we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we?
Who wants to be decent?..
That they're lying.
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
Of what?
But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
Yes?
No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
Excuse me?
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
Good job.  And thanks.
They'll kill me.
Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make him come to us.  Everybodyís got pressure points.  Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze.
What about him...?
And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
Good idea.
Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue
What happened to Jim?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
You're sure about this?
I didn't say that.
Is this the only way?
Two cars.  Where are you?
Ethan?
They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís dead too.  The disk is gone.
Youíre in Prague?
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.
Certainly Ethan.
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
That depends.
That's the question I want to ask Job.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
What was your deal with Job?
Let's move!
IMF mainframe.
Where exactly is it?
In Langley.
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
Jack.
I didn't touch it.
Stairway, youíre wrapped, go to transport.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Why?
Then what am I doing here?
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
I'm willing to take the chance.
Yeah.
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
You got it.
Good luck.
Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.
Too wicked to have a drink later?
And a lonely ass.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
Hello, Mr. Castorini.
I don't know what you mean.
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
Maybe.
Yeah.
That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
And what did they say?
I'm wearing your bracelet.
You have too many dogs.
I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
I don't know.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
A bride without a head!
Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
You don't get along with anybody!
What did I do?
I'm telling you you can't.
I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...
I wanna go home.
This is where we're going!
I'm afraid of who I am.
I was.
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Yeah, I'll be in.
Maybe you're right.
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
How about a month from today?
Alright. A month. In a month.
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
And who's gonna pay for that?
I got married before, you didn't sell.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old.
Did you see the moon last night?
Come on in.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
I don't know.
And you are a son who doesn't love his mother!
She was just too young for you.
Are you sure?
That woman was a student of yours?
Then why are you eating alone?
I'm too old for you.
It's a house.
Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
Burn them.
And what do you burn, apart from witches?
What do you mean?
Who are the Britons?
What?
Of course.
Oh, please!
No, no ... not "is"!
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
What?
My liege,  I am honored.
Who ... Who breaks out?
No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
Ni!
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
Oh, just some friends!
You know my name?
Yes, I can help you with your guest.
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...
Well ... I AM king.
Oh, very nice. King, eh!  I expect you've got a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food.  And how d'you get that? By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our society!  If there's EVER going to be any progress ...
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
And the hat.  But she is a witch.
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
I feel happy... I feel happy.
Thursday.
He hasn't got shit all over him.
Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.
Really, I feel fine, sir.
It just seems silly ... me lying here.
Is it?
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
What - the curtains?
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
Got it?
What?
We'll cover your escape!
Look - I'm fine!
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?
Louder, girl!
Yeah.
Out of my way!
Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
By whose authority?
We --
In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
Do you hunt?
What I do, I do for my Queen.
I do what I do.
She trusts you, John.
I'm glad of it.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
Aye, ma'am.
What?
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next.
Yes, ma'am.
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
No, ma'am.
So?
To know when he'll be king.
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
No, indeed.
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
Yes, ma'am.
I don't know, ma'am.  He was observed earlier, I believe.
Please make sure it does not happen again.
We were expecting you to return by six.
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
How do you stop The Screamer?
Sure.
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...
I came from the city on the left.
But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
Laurie's.
Like the fractals?
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
Then where do we go?!
I don't know.
They made ARCADE.  It's still a game, right?  It thinks like a game.  Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Dante's Inferno.
You didn't hear me?
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
Look around...
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
Sign me up.
Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of things...
Give her a chance, will you?
I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you get off my back?
I'm going home.
I'm going home Cynthia.
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
But I'm not broke.
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
One.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
So, what did they say?
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
What?
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
Before what?
Was anyone hurt?
Number 17.
You don't remember anything else?
When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
What is it? What do you see?!
This Denny's.
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Yeah.
The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
No time. Get him up.
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
I'm not fucking him..
You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
Excuse me ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
McCay had a lot money done into researching psychological reactions to questions that are seemingly unrelated, but reveal everything. Like criminal impulses, homicidal impulses.....
That was eleven years ago.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
Look...
Swimming, you know, like in water, moron.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
Where ?
Don't have to tell me twice.
When I think you're ready.
That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
I just want to double check the facts.
So ?
He already had a balance of $600,000.
Checking........
Fire the whole division.
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
Thank you, sir.
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
Sir ?
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
I was.
Aren't you the bitter one.
I think I'll see hat action.
What happened ?
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
Thank you, won't you come in ?
You have a real nice place... how can you afford this working as a temp ?
Wake up, we're in trouble.
I just need to sit and think for a second.
We made it !
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
Your Uncle Phil told me.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
Me, I'll know!
What do you remember about her.
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
Great.
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
Totally.
She just had a baby that's all.
Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?
Maybe he's hungry.
I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
I'd like to, thanks.
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
He likes you.
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
Then I have come to the right place.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
I want juice!
I won't.
You're so clever.
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
What if you don't wanna be found?
You would.
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
DON'T, come on!!!
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
What do you think?
Good-bye, look in your backpack.
I'd consider it a personal favor.
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
Uh huh, well...good to know. Phil hands Nick a               5 note
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Okay.
Well maybe for you.
You couldn't?
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
I'll see you then...I look forward to it.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
It would be fantastic.
Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
What Hurts Vada?
Yes they are.
The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
I wrote that.
Okay.
Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
Oh, how do you mean?
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
No, why?
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
I'll second that.
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter.
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
I love this guy! 
The money?
Soon honey, soon.
Why not?
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
For this class?
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
No.
He likes her.
Oh.
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
What are they about?
No, I'm divorced.
Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
They're just fun to read.
Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Oh no!  UUH.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
Hey, where does it say that?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
What?
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
I stopped that!
What?
Sure.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
Then go home, baby.
Leave then, some friend you are.
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
Desperate.  To talk.
When I'm talking to children.
Let's not get carried away.
Neosporin?
Good girl.
Which was the disqualifying factor?
What? Because I'm a little understand...
... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
A trademark move, don't touch it.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
Let me rephrase that...
He won't get mad, huh?
... that this is all my fault?
That's entirely understandable.
... unless he has a hump.
You've met her parents.
... Thomas, yeh.
... see, that's what I thought at first.  How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.
What's next?
Quite the little eccentric.
She finds him "personable."
First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
Never can tell.
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
Well.  How come she didn't...
Shhh.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
Well, it better not happen again.
I know that, Star.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
No.
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
How did you come in here?
You'll have to speak up.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
Bye, Bye.
It's on National television, Barnett.
Hal Phillip Walker.
Stop it!
When is it?
National?
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
Sure he will.
That's good,  I've never seen anything so healthy.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
I'm fine. Can I go up?
She sure sings nice.
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
Bet the sheets are grey.
Does their hair fall out?
Well, can you tell me why?
How long have you been with them?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
He's a member of our congregation.
Yes. Who's this?
Who is this?
What?
Doesn't it have a name?
Wrong.
Premeditated murder.
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
What...?  0h, yes.
It's me. What is it?
What time?
Hello.
Oh?
Mary?
Do you study at all?
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
I'll be dammed.
Is that good?
It's not bad.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
What...
We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please.
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
You've heard of it?
Ain't love grand.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Not good.
Yes.
Whose ratings were higher?
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
Tell me about the purity.
Describe Mallory.
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
That's indescribable.
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
No. Not really.
NO!!!
And they made the first move?
Unfortunately, yes.
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
Next week's episode.
Roger, no.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
Wayne Gayle!
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You a union man?
I'll smile when it's funny.
Like where?
Where's he at?
Just so you do your work.
I don't know.
I'll have me some of that punch there, too.
Went to college, huh?
In Birmingham.
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
Maybe.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
What d'you mean?
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
That's the way he is.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
What?
You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
What happened, Duff?
Don't push me, Duff.
Well, what d'you think?
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Yeah.
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
Watch out!
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
What d'you mean?
There's nothing to say.
I don't think that'll happen.
Duff--
I bet she's easy jam.
Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
Who're you?
Wouldn't have known you.
Okay.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
What d'you want anyhow? What you come and bother me for?
That's right.
No, thanks.
She'll do.
She don't look no worse to me.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
They'll run you out.
How 'you gonna live?
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
I doubt it.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
It's for your own good.
How you doin'?  Hi there!
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
He's my son!
Anything you say, baby.
She's coming, Omar, she's coming--
Omar, listen to me--
Since you got married.  You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
Help me send this Wintermute motherfucker straight down into it.
Can you walk?
Right...
Bright enough to be dangerous.
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
What are you talkin' about?
Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
Less than thirty minutes.
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
What?
You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.
Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
So you're a wire junkie.
Too late?
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
What?
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
Well, do you?
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
– uhh, must have forgotten-
No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
Anita, remember espadrilles?
Okay. That's bad.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
You need my help?
Wings?
I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Do I want to be crunched?
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
They hid my car--
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
Yeah, you gonna be there?
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Cool. I'll catch you later.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
Good.
Is that true?
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
You have to say that. You're my student.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
Yeah, I have.
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
But now you don't have to--
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
Yeah. Definitely.
We can handle it.
And heavy...
No!
I know.
Good.  I'm hungry.
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
Don't be a smart ass.
You know what I'm talking about.  What did you use, a fire cracker?  A cherry bomb?
And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
What is it then?  There's got to be an explanation.  Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
Ken!
My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
Are you nuts or something?
Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
How come?
Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
Wow...
World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
What's this?
Uh-uh.  Wait...
About what?
I'll get over it.
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
Who?  Who's doing this to you?
I can't!
Hi.
Yor dad picking the music again?
We're going to bed.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
I'll need to take her things.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
Can't it wait till morning?
He wears a dirty brown hat.  He's horribly burned.  He has razors on his right hand.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
He's close...
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
To old friends.
I -- I think so!
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
Why is that?
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
Nancy...
Call me Nancy.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
I can do that.
Remember -- open mind.
Hey, everybody has bad dreams.
You're about to attend a funeral.  One that's long overdue.
What?
Listen.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
I'm a vegetarian.
Oh God.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
Orange juice -- probably not.
No.
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Absolutely fine about it.
Okay.
That's fine.
Busy tomorrow?
Yes, you did.
With a goat playing a violin.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
Who was Gilda?
Stay forever.
Undressed like this, yes.
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
Okay.
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
What's the thing?
Yes.
That's nice.
Is Miss Scott staying here?
Where's Bella?
Of course.  And is he your favourite Italian film director?
Yes.  What do you think?
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
It was good.
Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.
Have you got a moment?
Well, fire away.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
So it could have been neither of them?
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
Really?
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
Yes.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Spike!
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
Yes, ma'am.
Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
No, it was irresponsible!
Why, thank you, ma'am...  Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else!  Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game?  I figured as much...
H-H-Hearts.
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
No.
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
Are they all crazies?
Wow! They're so quiet.
Where ya goin', Mac?
Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'.
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
I refuse!
Let me see your hand!
Gary Blinker...
Can you borrow me a dime?
Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change...
What's this?
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
In what way?
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Time out!
I'm not upset. All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus...
'Kay, Mac!
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
'Kay!
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
How 'bout twenty?
Bet!
Is everything all right?
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
I thought so.
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
So.  How do we get to Rome?
What's she doing?
--separate, in the evening..."
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
Hm.
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
That was before I found out what it was.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
Does he love you?
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
Because I don't have the right name?!
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
Tell me.
Mickey Spillane?
You too.
Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
No.  Are you're leaving?
What?
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
And more...
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying. 
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
What is it?
You think he misses me at all?
I never even got to be single.
Oh my God.  Where?
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Like a detective.
So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
What about Peter?...
Who said I was going?
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
Oh.
What about Larry?
Giovanni.
Huh?
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
Good strategy.
Mania.
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers—  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
What the hell!!!
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
Tommy, what happened?
You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.
They play pretty rough.
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
Want to go out and have one with me?
Our Lord said just the opposite.
But a priest...?
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now— but I think we're getting in love with each other.
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
Thanks just the same.
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
I'll find you a priest.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
What do you want from me, Father.
Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but—
Are you on the level, Father?
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
Our identification.
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
I think you could have.
I'm just resting my feet.
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
I'll see you on the roof.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I—
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
Listen, Johnny—
Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
I'm not sure...
I'm afraid I'll faint.
I am--It's our only chance.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
Maybe so.
You love me then?
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
When!?
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
All others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff, compared to <i>her</i>  This one would have <i>died</i> for feathers, furs, and fluff...and so she did!
Your pleasures of course!
You may take her now.
You better hope there is.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
Did you know that when you married him?
Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.
You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be.
You at least bring the gun?
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
Or two.
Just hung up.
How long you talk to her?
Two hours.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
Whatta you wanna do?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
They sure do.
Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
You talked to him?
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
They're in 7D.
You can go wait out in the car, you want to.
How are you, Raymond?
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
I thought everything.
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
Bleeding on a country road.
Shit...
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
Those guys bother you?
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
Where?
I told you, I'm not going back.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
Yeah?  She said that to you?
When?
Looks like tonight.
You know who they are?
It's a big house.
What's to think about?
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
The flight?
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
There were others.
Hejira.
Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
I remember you now.  Shit.
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it that way.  Go on.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
It's a guy you know.
It's Richard Ripley.
It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros.  I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick wall.  There's his drive, right there.
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
Me?
Can I do what?
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
Thanks.
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
He's about to.
You used to like it.
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
We don't get to talk much any more.
I'd like that.
He's pretty laid back, confident.
Not at all.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
I told you, he isn't here.
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
Likewise.
That's how you score now?
Ten gees.
Nervous?
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
Sir?
What lizard?
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
There's another one!
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
Come on!
Six P-40's.
No.  You're trying to beat me.
We've always tried to beat each other.
You were more like brothers.
Y-Yes Sir.
Thank you, Sir.
I know.
Our doctor's gone too.
You too, 'Mam.
I was hoping to meet him.
Nothing that won't heal.  I guess.
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
All of 'em.
Crank her!
The time has come to strike!  Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future.  I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong.  Yet look at their leader.
The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
I'd take better care of my teeth.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
Why do guys do such stupid things?
) Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". Page eighty—six.
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie.  Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
Great, isn't it?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
Who?
What am I going to do with you?
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love —— Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
Come back to me.
Are you for real?
I wish she hadn't.
He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once.  I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
What are you shooting for?
I can't do that.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
All right. But this better be good.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
How do you feel?
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
Sort of.
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
Am I dead or not?
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
Wbat're you talking about?
When do we start?
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Will you take of f your blouse?
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
Wait! I'll go with you!
Exactly! I thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or...
Well... uh... thanks...
My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
It sucked.
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
Zowie.
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
Why not?
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
K-R-O-one.
Maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. We'll try combinations of those letters...
Andy?
A reaction to AZT...
You're not smiling.
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
Close the law book.
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
No.
Ready for what, baby?
Honesty is always best.
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
Kids are great.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
Nine.
Your... lover?
Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet.
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
Except... you were gay?
I'm an excellent lawyer.
What do you love about it?
Where's Dad?
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Thank you. No more questions.
I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
Right.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
What kind of people?
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
Give me the camera, Joe.
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
I felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
On behalf of the defendants?
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
Show me your eyes.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
Saw something I didn't like.
Think about what?
Get out of our way.
You sure you can keep --
Riddick? How close?
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
You barely know them.
But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.
It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
Only around humans.
During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
Never said you were a hype, either.
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
79 kilos.
Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and <u>that's</u> why you can't come up with a better plan.
We're just burnin' light here.
Company's not here, is it?
Riddick?
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
And what about the cells?
Rain.
Has anyone checked the coring room?
It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.
Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
Not staying in here another....
They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
The best. But we won't need them.
I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
Shut up.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
Yo!
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Him.
These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
Climb off me, will you!
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
Okay.
Come on. Get me out of here.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
What is it?
All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
This is his assertion.
Where are they now?
He doesn't know.
What?
Where?
Yeah. Back about 100 metres. He's dead, now get going, the gooks are all over the fuckin' place.
Fuckers returned fire soon as we lit 'em up. Hard core fuckin' NVA. They got their shit together.
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
Das right dude. You be tryin' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke.
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Yeah?
Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
What?
You lame or something?
I suggest you watch your own asses cause Barnes gonna be down on ALL OF 'EM.
Wrong? You ain't EVER been right - 'bout nothing. And dig this you assholes and dig it good! Barnes been shot 7 times and he ain't dead, that tell you something? Barnes ain't meant to die. Only thing can get Barnes... is Barnes!
Feelin' good's good enough.
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
Nah...
I gotta didi man. Don't wanna miss that chopper. I'll send you a postcard. After I get me some. I'll send you some tapes too man. This new guy Jimi Hendrix man, whew... you okay Taylor? Just 'member take it easy now, don't think too much, don't be a fool, no such thing as a coward cause it don't mean nuthin. Jes keep on keepin' on. Okay my man...
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
I really don't know.
Indefinitely?
You don't know.
I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector.  A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.
I'm sure you have.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
Nobody I'd rather have on a leash.
If I change my mind.
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  Otherwise they might think...
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
It's always a mistake to run away. Always.
Bad enough.
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.
They know you here--know your name.
Then he's got to be a detective.
I don't think that's on the market anymore.  I'd like something much closer to the water.
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
Killaine's wise to what?
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
You-killed-him?
If I did-I don't-now.
Right, Miss.
That's an evasion and you know it.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
Is it a crime?
We try to be decent.
You understand perfectly.
There isn't anything you can do.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
Very ridiculous.
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
I'm not interested in blind dates.
Name it.
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
Got it on you?
Get it in half an hour.
You're not English.
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
Doesn't answer the question.
The only answer I have for you.
It could have been an accident.
That COULD BE TOLD.
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
A little something on account perhaps?
I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
I've met her.
It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him.  I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
Do I know who lives down there?
Pretty big chance, huh?
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
I am a fool.
How about Magruder?
That leaves two strangers.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
I don't know, sir.
Not too far, I hope.
This badge is not an old newspaper you can cast down on the desk.  It is not a thing you can give up as of no value.  It may be taken from you--and you may die defending it. But you'll not use it to make cheap dramatic gesures with.  It's a naked steel of the sword of Justice.  Put it back in your pocket and hold tight to it--and someday you might grow into a worthiness ye lack now.
So-so.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
Yes.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
I think you'll do very well.
Yes.
Well, we were just...
Penfield.  James Penfield.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
Both dead.
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
In radio we're different.
I haven't really thought about it.
He's all right, the professor.
We were just chortling over that. Blasé and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today.
It's shit.
No need to thank me, if you don't want to.  Just pay for these drinks.
Are you up to something?
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
Dad.
Yes, you said.
I won't.  Goodnight.
They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
Naw, you pull it!
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
I need you to teach me.
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
Who cares!
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
What story did you give to Davis?
There's no sign of it.
Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
Twenty-five percent.
Hope to be?
I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
How?
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
What's your name, lover.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Do you plan everything?
Yes...
If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Why not?
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
I know.  I'm glad.
Right.
Afternoon.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
I know a lot of nice girls.
No one you know.
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
Doing what?
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Have a good day, gentlemen.
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
Kit!  Where've you been?
Why'd he want you?
You bullshittin' me?
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
I like steak.
I'm just looking, thanks.
Yes.  Something... conservative.
Do you remember me?
All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard.
I just might do that.
Till they kill you. Yeah.
You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave...  ... but nobody withstands The Machine. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.
I swear it will be done.
You're a silly girl.
They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
He knows I do not love him.
But what if something happens to you?
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
Well ... you were dead.
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.
No. No. We have already succeeded.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
You never said anything about killing anyone.
Veer left. Left. Left!
Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.
Everybody ... MOVE!!
All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
Oh, have it your way.
You've made your decision then7
I will. And I choose --
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
A little bit.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Oooooooops!
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Mr. Bialystock, not more than five minutes ago, against my better judgment, I doctored your books. That, sir, is the ultimate extent of my criminal life.
How's this? 
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ...
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
What???
With whom?
Really, I never dreamed ...
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
We swear it!
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
Goodbye, my angel ... My angel!  Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ... Lucretia, Lucretia!
Good.  Good.  Now ve sign the contract.
Where are you going vit the light?
Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.
I mean in show business.
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
Oh.
No.
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
And when she left, she never came back.
Money.
Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
Must've needed it.
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
Like what?
He said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
I was getting to that!
Just wait here?
Sam.
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
Yes.
Bates never denied Mary was here.
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
Thank you, Norman.
You slept here all night?
No, m'am.
I'm sorry.
No need to apologize...
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
Arbogast.  And after he left?  No, it's okay, Norman. How's it been going out there?  Well, I think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action, a smaller place, you know... but...
I suppose you want a cabin.
Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
Mother, please...
From what?
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
I don't know, [I tell you].
Maybe you want my money, too.
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
I'd like to have a look.
I'm going to call the police.
No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
But ... the dogs...
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
I'll have it for supper.  So long.
I'd love to, at any time.
What do you think I am?
It happens that I'm the law.
How quaint. But I can go any place you can. 
You mean he was colored?
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
What!
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
No kiddin'.
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
That's what they're going to ask you.
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
What universe are you in, Paul?
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
So I can move on.  You too.
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
Aw, be a good sport, Rose.  You like me, don't you? I like you a lot.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
Buddy, you're just a child.
Good night, Rose.
I said I wouldn't.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
I ain't neither. Listen here, Buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas.
I don't want to know...
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
Take a little walk with me, huh?
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
Well, a little.
What's taking the rascal so long?
What did you say, Brother?
Oh, yes, it's Thursday.  Hello, Rose, dear...  ... my, you're... looking pretty...
She's watching the car again?
Okay.
They're discussing it.
I can't see, let me see...
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
Here comes Daddy.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
How could that be, son?
A wonderful woman, boy.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
Excuse me, I'll be right back.
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
What do you think of her, honey?
Well, she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in Birmingham, even if she did run away from them.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
She already told you, she doesn't know.
Is anything wrong?
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
Yes, air.
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
Nothing, Rose.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.
You'd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself, you'd go that far? Don't you think I know what you've just said and don't you think I understand the dreadful and revolting crime you've just conspired to commit?
You can stop it right now.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
Okay, man, okay.  I'm with you.  I... I heard how the shit's arriving...  It's coming in a Lincoln.
Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
Careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.
Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
Again.
This scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the Mexican border high as a kite for the next two years.  You think we're gonna let Zimmermann haul it onto <U>our</U> streets on the Fourth-of-fucking-July!?
Thank you, concerned citizen.
That wasn't my fault.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
Wha... ?
Speak for yourself.
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
It's our job.
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
Your wish is my command.
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
I'm well aware of that.
Beholden to none.
Know what I love about dynamite?
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
Keep 'em busy.
Well, let me tell you how it is...
All right. Stand by.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Jabba's palace.
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
All set.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
Oh, no.
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
Yes.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
How many languages do you speak?
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
Disintegrated?
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
Janet.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
Weiss.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Dealing
Oh.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
Shell-shocked!
By accident?
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
It doesn't bother me either.
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
Do you have a phone?
It's okay.
Ya puttin' me on, right?
It did.
Sharp -- Real nice.
...I can't beat him.
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
No... I can't!
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
Only a pig would say that!
What?!
Give my main man a raise!!
...I don't feel heat from the name.
People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
You're hurtin', man!
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
Very high an' very fast.
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
...Ten minutes.
Please, I need my hands to work -- Christ, don't bust my thumbs.
Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
Paulie's sister.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
Did you hear what I said?
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
Ya, somethin' like that.
The legs must be goin'.
Yeah, Kayo.
Message -- What message?
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
Freak luck is a strange thing.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
Check the eyes, Ben.
Fine... That guy's great.
Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
Bullmastiff.
He's takin' cheap shots.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
Sure I like her.
What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!
Do you feel you have a chance?
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
Bastards put him on notice.
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
Surprised?
That's right, me.
Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
That's what you woke me up for?
Doom.
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
Have you got the will?
Yeah, that's better.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
A Toon?  Noooo.
Get away from there.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
Uh? Uh?
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Tempt not a desperate man!
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Why, what is Tybalt?
In love?
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
Goodnight.
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
You kiss by the book.
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
Well what shall I swear by?
Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
A Plague o' both your houses.
What wouldst thou have with me?
I am for you.
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
I don't know.
So where do you go from here?
How do we know that?
That's why you were riding with him.
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
It's been known to happen.
I thought I did.
Not yet...
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
I still am.
That's right.
I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
Ready when you are...
We'll double your price.
I think not.  After you...
He's company.
Bad company...
In here...
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.  Your orders might be different from mine.
And you respect him.
Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
Not for long.
Is that right?
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Is that right?
To see a man about a thing.
I can do that.
I didn't know that you spoke French.
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
Know what?
That there was a gun pointed at me.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
And what job is that?
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
I'm going with you.
I know of him.
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
Dark ops?
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.
Would you stop with that...
Because I don't walk away.
Do you have a good answer?
I'll work on it...
What of it?
I know.
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
Why don't we step into my office...
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
It's a matter of respect.  Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long.
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Why?
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
What makes you so sure?
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
What are you thinking?
I don't know...
I can't do that.
He would have done it to us, right?
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
Do you have everything?
Yes it is.  I'm calling it in.  Right now.
Why don't you get to the point.
We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
Yes.  Wife and a kid.  Don't blame yourself, Deputy.  You did all you could.  You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing. It's not worth it.  Remember what happened the last time?
I know.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
I love you.
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
Don't you think I would have told you that!
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
I don't suppose you've seen her.
No, I can't say that I have.
Uh...C?
Dammit you’re persistent.  I don’t want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
Well I'm here now.
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Forget it.
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
You'd do this to me!
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
No, I just assumed...
Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the help.
What??  Where'd you hear that?
Is this about the funny money?
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.
They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
No.  It's my first time.
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
You better take one.  Your breath has been a little funky all day.  Let me look at you.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
And you ain't black!
IT IS CRAZY!
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
What?
She's walking back towards the door.
I don't need a turn!
Get it out of here!
It doesn't matter.
Well we're not friends.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
What about a little king pao chicken?
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
Follow me my Asian brother.
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
How do I know I can trust you?
Now you know.
Baby Duck?
Thank you.
You must come with me for questioning.
The police can protect you.
There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
Shut up!
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
We are both full of shit.
Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
Shortcut?
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
Stool pigeon.
Yeah, somethin' like that.  OK, now this is a nasty ass place. When you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. You got to maintain control. You following me? You lose it, you get hurt. Now, you're my responsibility and I don't want you hurt. You understand?  OK, let's go.
Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
Yeah, it's good.
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  Œscuse me.
Yes, I know this song.
Who does not know War?  ³War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.²
No, fish is a PM food.
This concrete?  This is still America.
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
Oh yes.
You know him?
Oh, I think you like this very much.
That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
Shut up!
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Ambassador Han.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
Yes.
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
About her upcoming wedding and all.
Looking for Maggie.
Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
You can turn that finger around.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
Bob will be very happy.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
You humiliated me!
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
Yes I do!
Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
Yup!
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
Would it?
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
Is there somebody else?
Nope.
That's good.
What am I going to do with a microwave?
It sounds nice.
No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.
Am I what they had in mind?
We'll stay at the Plaza --
I don't think so.
No.
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
At the top of the Empire State Building --
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
Yes.
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
I know.
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
Come on, Jonah --
Yes.
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
We'll move them --
How amazing.
Destiny takes a hand.
What?
Magic.
Shhhh --
It's been about a year and a half.
And I don't want to invade your privacy --
What's she talking about?
It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife.
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
You'll see.
I don't get it.
But how am I going to get there?
It's a spice rack.
Right.
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
It doesn't.  They ask you.
Will she scratch up your back?
I'm starting to forget her.
WAIT!!!  -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore."  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
Perfect.  We'll be there.
I just called for a second.
It's a short word.
Was Mom an adjustment?
This is the one I like.
What's wrong with Annie?
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
If I didn't go.
No.
We ought to start camping again, Dad.
Hi.  Sam?
What do you mean?
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
Oh.
Whose side are you on anyway?
Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
What?
No, no ...
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
No.
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
Hunting.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
But honey ...
Or why don't you just put a sign outside? "No dogs or women allowed!"
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
My kids don't have enough to eat!
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
You mind?
Shhh.
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
I can't leave.
Fuck you.
Trust me. We're safe.
And you admire that?
I try.
Nothing.
You really need to lighten up.
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
I just can't. Okay?
I can't tell you.
Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
Twelve
Can you set that up?
10%.  That's ...
No  You think she's a tweaker?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Yes, Jimmy.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Anything for a dear friend.
Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously.
Why do you say that?
Pull your motherfucking pants down.
I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
Tell me what?
Bubba.
You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
The Mexicali Boys
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
They have. But they never found a lab.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
What is it, drugs?
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
Figured.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
You take account of the wind?
Shut up, will you?
Cap'n...?
Of course, sir.
I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity.
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
Pass.
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
Same place we are.
But, sir...
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
You're kidding yourself.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Yeah.
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted.
Yes, sir.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Yeah, how so?
But I am a captain.  If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...
Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.
No, sir.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
Yeah?  So?
Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
No, no he's not.
Understanding the following rights...
Okay, thanks.
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
Yes.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
Alright.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
Tell me, is it bad news?
No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
I like him a lot.
Just finishing up in here.
What am I supposed to think?
I made their lives better.
That's right, work it out.
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
Yeah.  What a day.
You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?
Goodbye.
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
So it's an honor?
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
You know what?
Basic.  Hmmm.
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
Today is tomorrow.
Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
I'm doing alright.
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
No.
You're shaking.
It was wonderful.
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
No I didn't.
I love you.  Please, I love you.
Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
What?
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
So what's up?
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
What?
We'll just make an appointment for you at Seattle Junior College.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
You know Diane Court?
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
Klaus Tauber.
Oskar, please -
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
It's bad business.
I pay you too much.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
What's going on?
That's great.
Nice things cost money.
What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
I think most people right now have other priorities.
Something they can hold in their hands.
Christmas presents.
And killing.
I think it's too late.
Yes.
Well, sure.  So would I.  So would you. I wouldn't worry about it.  We'll get it right one of these days.
That doesn't work, sir.
On national television.
No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...
I won't.
Don't. Think Bailey.
Stop it...
Cici. Who's this?
No, it's me.
I thought you were going to the mixer?
I had to change. Did anyone call?
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
It helped me realize one thing.
It’s over, Cotton.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
Tons and tons.
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
We’re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
He filmed his victims.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
Dewey, there's no such place.
I'll give you one guess.
I'm sorry.
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
Are you in danger now?
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek.
She's not here right now.
You are so not funny.
You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
Me, too. Randy. Me too.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
Asshole, Can't talk.
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
And who would that be?
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
Absolutely.
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Sid, get in my car. You're coming back to the station with me where it's safe.
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
No really?
Bitch.
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
What are you talking about?
Let's get out of here!
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
Yes, sir.
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
You lost your mom...
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
I don't know.
I think you have the wrong number.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
I don't think so.
I want to now who I'm talking to.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Or else what?
No...
I'll even give you a warm up question.
No...
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
Then what are you doing here?
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
Shit.
Yeah.
Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid.
Afraid not.
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
About thirty seconds.
Just stay back.
Forget it.
For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
And why is that?
...out at the airport...
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
We had a run in the mass murder section.
So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
How do you gut someone?
No, nothing's like it used to be.
I don't know...
And you believe it?
Oh, god...
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
TATUM!
Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
Tits -- see.
Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
There was a second.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Really?
It would be too hard.
He had a gun.  He had a gun... and he made it happen.  He made me do it!  He made me put that... that thing on.  Oh, Christ!  He made me wear it... and... and he told me to fuck her.  He had the gun in my mouth.
Her pretty head.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
Murderers like you?
Really?  Just biding your time, then? Toying with me.  Is that it?  Letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in?
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink?  Near the food?
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
Forced what?
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
Satisfy our curiosity?
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
What?  Assessing fines?
You got to be kidding.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
How do you know all about this?
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
What did you say?
I... I don't understand.
Oh... um, William.
Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
He mentioned it.
I don't know...
I want to have children.  It's just...
I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision.  I'm positive. But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided differently.
When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together.  She was crying too hard to say anything.
I don't know.
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
I ain't wearing no gun.
No sir...pleasure.
Captain Clayton...Captain!
Well you found me...Good work, son...Good work.
Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar...
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
And maybe you lie...
That'll be the day...  'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
You've done a lot of growin'...
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
Why?
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
He just couldn't wait...
Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
It isn't fair...
Only if I'm dead!
Do you have a better idea?
Someone from the village.
Yeah... I have to go to town.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
What?
I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
It's good.
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Lady?
You have the last act?
You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
What is the chief part?
Ned is wrong for it.
Done.
No, no. You have a wife, children
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
Yes, I saw it.
That's me.
Put his feet in.
by order of the Master of the Revels!
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Nobody knew!
What happened to Sam?
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
What? Who?
How goes it, Will?
And yours?
What is the story?
Romeo is…Italian. Always in and out of love.
The daughter of his enemy.
Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!
Be still.
Above Lord Wessex?
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
"She speaks.
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
Will Shakespeare!
Oh
Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
You never spoke so well of him.
You lie.
I was the more deceived.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Christopher Marlowe at your service.
Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches!
With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
Serve.
Just serve.
It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
You call them if you want.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
You think so?
I don't know.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
About the mail --
Well?
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
Know and love?
Open it.
No.
I don't want to. It's different.
OK.
I want my money back. Excuse me.
That's not him.
Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
We could put it somewhere.
Oh.
No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
What?
We were just sorting things out.
That's what I thought he said.
Don't you ever stop?
What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right?
What about?
Burglary?
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
I'd be delighted.
I see.
Writing seems easy.
All right.
The first one was fine.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
I don't know, I think...
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Why?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
Wow.
But you don't know what happened.
Calm down, baby.
Nummers.
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I know.
No.
Chopped liver?
Gee, this is great.
Am I what?
What?
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
Great.
I've got heads here, Norman.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
Great... so how's everything with you?
No, I'm sure.
Okay.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
And what?
There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something.
Hey, I don't tell.
Well, did you or didn't you?
You did, didn't you?
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
I don't want to... I swear...
Sit down!
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
What about it?
I don't know what gets into me.
You were great.
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
Nothing.
-- do you want ice?
Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
I don't know -- I've got to.
What?
Yeah?...
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
That's too bad.
Here in the canyon.
You'll do what I tell you. Now get the fuck inside.
Right now -- I'm at the epitome of my life. Right now I feel so good I'm afraid something's gonna happen.
I am?
Okay, baby. Okay...
Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
Egypt!
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
Great... can we talk later?
George.
Yeah, baby.
Right now?
Look, baby, can we talk about it later?
I'll call you.
I'll call you.
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
Who?
A business meeting, I told you that.
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
Yes.
You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
-- yes.
Stop it.
What did you say?
I said you were a loser!
No?
I see.
But what?
I'm better than the guy I work for.
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
Okay.
Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
Godammit, George...
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
No thanks.
What about her?
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
Wasn't sure it was you.
No.
Awww --
Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
I was too old.
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Sid.
You do?
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
Steve?
Oh, I'm sorry.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
No.
C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
See you later.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
I know, I'm sorry.
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
-- No. No really.
It must be something.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
Well, you know what I mean.
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
-- Yesss?
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
... Mmm-hmmm.
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
Oh that's no problem.  -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
That's fine --
No... how long did you say?
-- we're going to be here all night.
What?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
What do you mean?
No, Dad.
Good.
Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.
You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
Okay.
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Yes.
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
Sure.
Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Good evening Mr. Torrance.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
Your money's no good here.
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
I know it.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Stop swinging the bat.
Go away.
Give me the bat.
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
Not for me.
I'm intrigued.
No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
Good.
Yeah, I know. It's great!
Yeah... sure.
Was it a prescription?
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
It could have been anything, Marty.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
But Uncle Al! You said-
I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
What you say?
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
What?
He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell.  For all eternity.
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
Yes, Betty?
Oh my! 
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Why?
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
It's true -- I know her.
What a shame!
Pay attention...
Enough jabber.
Like this place?
A cigarette?
Experience!  Right?
Honey.
Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
Give me a C.  A C!
A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
Don't you know it!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
You were unhappy?
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
I see.
What's a concubine?
Can do.
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
What's wrong with my life?
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
We are nuns.  We seek solutions through prayer.
What?
The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the gold.
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
Oh?
Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here?
Really?  Lieutenant?
You're not... seeing anybody?
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
I'm telling you!
Yeah, right -- when I see it.
We can't leave it up to the Feds!
It's better than ice cream.
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
Many have.
Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
I was afraid of this.
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
Bring him.
Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father.  That is the closest you ever come to God.
Pardon me?
Have they nothing to fear presently?
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself.  Someone out there cared for him.
What kind of nuts?
Listen.
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
In test... what?
What does it mean?
No.  They are all missing.
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
Other people?
It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk.
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
I... I can't do this.
We have no choice.
Where?
I didn't see none.
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
Father saw you die.
He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.
I can't remember.
There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too."  Get it? That's a goodun.
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
Can I see him?
Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
Well, what did you want?
Karl's my name.
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
You don't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low.
You know better than to talk like that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make me knock the piss out of you.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
Don't tell me what to do.
Don't tell me what to do.
What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
Yeah.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
Did you want to play ball with us?
All right then.
How do you know?
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
Well, I hate him.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
Hit was right thoughty of her.
Yeah.
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
You threw it in a trash barrel?
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.
You better go get 'em.
I'll be.
I didn't aim to.
I'll be dog.
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends.
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
I wouldn't never hurt them.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
No! At least I don't think I am!
Better make it charge. 
And your father? Is he from New York?
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
Do me a favor, will you?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
It's kind of overwhelming.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
Every word.
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
Like what?
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Yeah, like what?
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
Sure thing. See you later.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
And?
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.
What do you want me to say?
What are you talking about?
Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
You work too hard, you know that?
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
Medium rare, please.
Yes, please.
You want another one of these, too?
That's obvious.
You scraped the dried blood from the <u>butt</u> of the gaff.  Where a fella's <u>hand</u> goes.  And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
None.
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen...
Happy for him.  And relieved.
Why?  We're only talking.
The Japs did it.
Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
Objection!
Tht was summation, Your H...
Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.
Won't take two.
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
I was checking the cables.
You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait.
Maybe.
You have to wonder.
No.
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
And her farmhouse...?
As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
The same.
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
Me?  I'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman.
I don't know - but I can feel it right here.  That's one good thing about ulcers - it's like a burglar alarm going off inside you.
Thank you ever so.
Of course I am.
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!
You'd better go fix it.
I got pinched in the elevator.
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
Shut up and keep packing.
Terribly sorry.
See you around, girls.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
What's that?
You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
Yeah - Josephine.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
Oh - here and there - and around.
We could -
What's with him - he drinks?
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
No, thank you.  I'll walk.
I'll throw up!
Well, then, why don't we go dancing? I know a little road-house, down the coast -
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
And I can never have children.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
That's good thinking.  Daphne's a push-over for him.
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
You ain't going nowhere.
Thank you.
The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
It's three weeks in Florida -
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
We'll take it!
Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
Afford it?
Me?
That so?
Yeah.
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
I want mine to wear glasses.
They get those weak eyes from reading - you know, all those long columns of tiny figures in the Wall Street Journal.
Who are you?
Now, really -
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
Shell Oil?
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
They shrink when they're marinated.
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
You mean we're alone on the boat?
Harmless - how?
What thing?
Complete washout.
Oh, no!
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
Mineral baths - now really!
It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
Smart move.  Oh, by the way - did you get my flowers? You know, those orchids from my greenhouse - the fog finally lifted over Long Island, and they flew them down this morning.
You'll forget him, Sugar.
I know.  Every time!
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
And who runs it?
Refresh my memory.
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
What for?
Your probably best off pretending you’re asleep.
Why, with you.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
There’s something about him that’s just a bit odd.
But, somehow, it was Kat’s arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
I slept with your sister.
You have feet?
Love.
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
Your “friend” guaranteed my anonymity.
Oh, no.
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
Show me.
What?
Oh, cut the crap!
Hi.
Of course, don’t be silly.
Ahoy!
Just drunk enough.
Is there any other way to take it?
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
You could? How?
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
Go on...
Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
NO! N-O, NO!
Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Where was you, Daddy?
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
Come here, son...
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
Sunday...
Sausage and hambones!
Act like one!
Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
Yes, ma'm...
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Maybe soon--
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
Tired.
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
But what are we going to do against this entire army?
Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
I know what it is!
Boobie... This is the only way you're ever going to learn. I have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences.
FREEZE!!
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
Kay.
We can't leave without you!
It's okay, I am done for.
Our moms suck!
I don't know, dude.
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
Oh God... What have I done...
No, it was worse than that...
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
I am.
I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign.
So what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh?
Yup.
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Wendy?
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
It can't be.
Excuse me?
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
I'm sure I will.
They are awaiting further information.
And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac...
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
I can hardly wait.
Good help is hard to find...
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Why can't we?
Words to live by.
I'll do my best.
That's right.  Will you marry me?
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
The engines!
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
That's affirmative.
Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
It's splitsville for you.
Sheila, meet...uh...  I forget the name.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
Thanks.
I gotta survive.
I couldn't care less.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
Clam it!
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
It depends.
You shouldn't touch her.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
I don't want to play.
SHEILA!
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
132, 154.
I'm a bowler.
He's my father, Millie.
Whips...orange whips.
Uh...over easy.
The mental hospital.
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
I'll be at the bridge.
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
We would have sooner or later.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Fuck plan C!
I am a professional man.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
Please, Dr. Levine.
Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Thirty yards.
What team?
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
From what?  What's with all the security?
A thousand feet.
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
Geologists?
-- dating the crash at least that old.
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
Take a look.
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
Wait a second --
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
Working on it now, sir.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Harry?  Can you copy?
They've left, keep watching!
I did.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
He understands me fine.
What -- you want me to retype it?
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
What is it?
We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
Yeah, why?
You bastard.
You, me and Harry?
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
"... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster."
Antihistamine.  For bites.
How do you spell it?
It's like a sleeping pill?
Only lab rats.  Here.
Not believing you.
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
Are you manifesting them?
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
No, he can't.
Someone did.
You manifested that, Beth.
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
I promise --
Beth --
Beth -- gimme the gun.
What?
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
How's that?
It's an American spacecraft.
Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
I don't follow you.
Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
Harry?
Beth left?
Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
I heard!  I heard!
It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
Just one of Norman's many secrets.
Meaning?
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
What was that, sir?
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
Know what?
Please, Ted.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
All right then, we'll use your plan.
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry.  They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
You mean we should go after her!...
Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
I think I did.
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.
It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major.  It appears your data never got through.
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
Your father's dead.  Don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. If you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long.  I don't want another word.  Finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those 'droids.'
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Well, ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
See Threepio!  Do you copy?
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
He was our teacher... He was great.
Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet...
Sir, no, sir.
Sir... I guess I do, sir.
In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
Excuse me...!
You're upset, that's alright.
I don't know, Zander.
I do.
Who ?
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
It's all I think about anymore.
I thought you were going to help Carl.
It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
I'll meet you outside.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
Just throw me the ball, Diz.
Guess you gotta go.
What's that, Diz ?
What ?
It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
Oh, is that how it is ?
Sir, thank you, sir !
Doesn't look like it to me.
Uh, no.
You can never be sure.
I'm gonna save Carmen.
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir !
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
The information will not be disclosed.
Yes.
Mr Decker....
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
A tractor beam...
No.
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Thrusters ahead, one third.
Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Tractor beam remains constant...
He have any special dietary requirements...?
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
Yes...
As the Old Mill goes around...
Mister White is...
I...
He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...
You got a paperclip?
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
Better idea...
You have to sign for it.
The other side.
...because if you don't, they die...
Later on.
Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
Go you Huskies!
That's something a man could do...?
Well ain't you amazing.
But it'll stop the movie.
I'm going to tell the truth.
Water or mineral deposits.
Go you Huskies...
That's right...
I beg your pardon?
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
I'm sorry.
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
Hi.
And I need a drink.
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
She wasn't in the...
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
What'll I do for fun?
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
I'm having dinner with W...
Bourbon and Milk.
Page...<u>three</u>.  Now:  "It's a nice evening."  I'm not gonna say that... "It's a nice..."
Tell it with...
She's a...
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
...we had a script conference...
I just...
Yes, yes, but...
You can't do what?
...I...
Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.
...wants a piece...
...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
That isn't very nice.
<u>Did</u> I?  I think you're mistaken.
It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's sposed to point down to accentuate the <u>genitals</u>, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his <u>ears</u>...?
Doug, the traffic light...
Arrest him.
He didn't have to tell...
Okay...
Gut Yuntif.
He saw the accident...?
It burnt down.
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
I...
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
To the contrary.  I want you to tell the truth.  The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.  You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on.  And you have a fertile imagination.  Imagination wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  If you aren't <u>sure</u>, then they have nothing.  Bob walks free.  As he should.  Joe:  wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart.  You know?  The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they fear us.  Because we tell the truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a damn roust, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself.  If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community...to our community, you understand...?  To our world.  Cause you are a part of that world, now.  You have to take off the Steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.  And be part of your world.  I got a five picture deal with the studio.  And you stick with me.  You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll <u>direct</u> the third one.  You are a part of this world. It's in your blood.  It's you.  You have to do the right thing:  we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, <u>literally</u> is at our door.  You have to stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the bottom line. You <u>have</u> to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in the car.
...would you excuse me, please...
What did you say to them...?
I don't...
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
Find the money.
<u>Find</u> it.
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...
What are you gonna talk about?
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
No, that never solves anything.  You talk like the big girl you are.  About what you feel.  And how he's hurt you. You know?  You tell the truth.
Don't. Take me with you.
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
You lost Ben?!
MOMMY!
No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
No!
No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that.
I knew where I was all the time.
Yes...if you like big hair...
Do me a favor?  Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay?  Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
Ben where do you have to get to?
Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
Remarried.  There is no move.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
And I'm supposed to care.
WE are over.
WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
Anxiety.
She was angry at herself.
Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
You're not dying.
See, I know that.
I have given them more<u>love</u> and more <u>care</u> every fifteen <u>minutes</u> of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty <u>years</u>!
Ironic, huh?
You're a cross-dresser.
It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
You mean, after I'm dead?
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
And I'm going to win.
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
Neutral ground.  What's up?
Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
Rache, it may take time.
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
'...the kids have camp.  Their friends are here.  Over there, I'll just be shopping in a language I don't even know.  My life, and the kids' lives, aren't here to service your mid-life crisis.'  Did it go like that?
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Don't ever say that.
What if he is?
He isn't.
What?
You heard me: leave the table!
Oh, yeah?
And like, don't take this the wrong way...I mean, I'm cool...but...you know...I've got a good reputation at school and, well...I really don't want it ruined.
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Yes.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
Must've been hard being poor.
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
Speak English.
He's dead.
Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
Huh?
I can read it to you.
You mean, again?
Oh. What happens now?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Your story was terrible!
The same.
We have to talk.
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
Gee, you're home early!
What are you doing here?
Can I join you?
Take off your top.
Say, 'Nigger.'
No.
I hate reading.
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
So what's going on?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?
That's too bad.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Hunh.
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
How'd you get it?
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
Prnceton.
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
Who's got matches?
We're outta here--
By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.
I guess not Cooper...
Are the labs in operation?
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
I insist...
She's still alive.
He's in there...
She's as good as gone...
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
Get your men to do it!
Don't be ridiculous.
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
Certainly, General.  Why do you ask, sir?
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
And lastly, all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded.  They can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs. Air Police will have lists of all owners.
That's right, Major.
And if that were true?
We've come a long way since World War II, Major.  And the lessons we've learned are all in Plan-R.
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
Admiral Buldike?
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
Hello, are you still there?...Uh-huh...I'll be right back.  We're still working this thing out.
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
I don't think so.
Maybe it's an exercise.
Check.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
They must have made a visual contact.
Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
Shoot, Lothar.
As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes.  All right?
All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
Let me check.
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Slides go with it.
Typical male.
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Right now?
Do you wanna go to the van?
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
Yeah.
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
Watch out for that tree.
So you can do an album cover?
Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what we need? A hot cop of coffee. Hand on. Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man. A long, long, long night.
No, no, I wasn't trying.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
Good.
Yeah.
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
What?
She's in the van.
Buff...
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
It's bullshit. Look! Look!
So, how was the ride, kids?
Really?
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Good. See you later.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
A reel?
Military marching bands.
What was your name again?
Erica.
Deep down. Way down.
That's what I mean.
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Funny shit, man.
Thank you.
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...
No.
Oh fuck.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
Is that Bee-Bee?
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
No.
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
No one does nothing, Jeff.
So you sold ninety thousand units. So what? Does that mean you're a genius? You're a great artist? You're higher up the ladder? You got an extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead?
No. No, no, no.
Mm.
Well, what about us?
You're unbelievable.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
Just go.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Yeah, I crash there.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
What?
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, yeah.
Get off my property!
Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
Would I get paid?
Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Well, use your head, "Stalker Betty."
Conan went to Harvard.
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
I personally think of how Conan started as a writer, then became a...
Positive.
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Huh?  Oh Jesus...
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
You're kidding.
Hold on...
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
I hear she was a terror to work with.
Action! The scene starts.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
That was the general idea.
Close, but no cigar.
Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten-carat kidney stone.
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
Life can be beautiful!
You did?
Into what? A lampshade?
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
What about all those ideas you had?
Check.
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
You're tough, all right.
You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
Nice job.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Why did she call me?
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
Come on, Joe.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Yeah?
What month?
I want you to do this work.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
I'll take care of that.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
What scene?
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
I need some money right now.
You'll need them for parties. You'll need them for New Year's Eve.  Where are your evening clothes?
Who?
I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself.  He was afraid of catching cold.
A little.
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
Great stars have great pride.
When did he say it, Norma?
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
Madame is waiting.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  Where did he come from? Who is he?
Thank you, Max.
But where?
Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention.
He will be. In about five minutes.
That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
Western Europe.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
Come on, let's ride.
Tell me where I can find her.
You don't like me? You hate me?
No.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
But why?
I sort of like what you said.
What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
But what if---it wasn't real?
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
She'll forget about us eventually.
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
How do I fight it?
I'll come back as soon as I can.
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
I'll mention it upstairs.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Supergirl?
Well...I guess I can't.
Theories?
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
It was just a trim.
I'm Linda Lee.
You're wasting your breath.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
I don't scare that easily.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Why?
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
Mr. Roebush?
Tuesday.
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
Not enough vodka in it.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
Too much mayonnaise?
Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
You thought that?
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
Me neither...
Can I help?
Uh-huh.
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Oh?
Yeah.
Dishwasher? Any luck?
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
Yeah. A raise . .
Say who?
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
First question got to be "Where."
What?
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
That's his sister. Vera Webster.
What about you?
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
In other words, push this red button.
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
Yeah. I'll check.
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Hostages?
Uh. . .
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Maybe I could try --
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
Lois, I . . .
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
Say you love me.
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
I like worrying about you.
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
I'll be alright.
No possibility for parole?
Oh magnificent one. What I am bargaining with is what you do not have -- the son  of Jor-El.
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all into that molecule chamber. It takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. Now if you could . . .
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
		DELETE IN CUTTING
I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
N-no...I mean...you bet.
Mr. White, come with me I want to see
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
But why the hair?
There!
You're just an experiment, freako!
If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
First, I have fun.
What do you fear?
I am master now.
High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
Thank you.
Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and  --
Unbelievable.
Not in Metropolis it isn't. This is the home of the sneak attack, the stab in the back, the --
Big night coming up?
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
You're just jealous.
Jealous? Of what?
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
This??
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
I'm going to bed.
Bingo!
No, you're going to get kissed,
I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
We just take it?
Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle.
I know...
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
We don't want a child called 'Junior,' ain't that so, Clark? Why sure it is.
Lara, please...
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
Do as I say. Let go!
Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
It must feel great.
195 pounds.
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
But...why?
Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
In a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot.  There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero.  Pancho's Taco Palace...
We'll see how fast I can fly.
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
Alison.
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
With our hands.
We've only got honey.
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
Who's Mr. Stephens?
Did he say what about?
Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
It's like a song.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
Why?
Hard to say.  I might have...some business here.
There's the Prescots...
That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
How old is she?
Is this it?
Tell me your news, Zoe.
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
Who did they get for that?
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
Until the accident?  No.  Yes, there was.
Yes.
You remember this?
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
Very slick.
And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
I don't know.
But Charlene...
The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
Right!
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
Susan!...
Can I come in for a minute?
Not "we", Sidney, you!
How?
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
Sidney, I know human nature.  Susie lied to me - she'll see that boy again.
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
You're sure.  Find out for me.
At the bar - Sidney...
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"?
Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
What would you think of me if -
May I rent you out as an adding machine.
I hate to see you like this --
Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
It is a favor, isn't it?
Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I came to bring him a present.  Wanna bite to eat?
Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
Come on now, chickie, why don't you go to bed...?
Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.  Everything! I don't care.
Anything it samples by physical contact.
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
That is one of my mission parameters.
Chill out, dickwad.
No.
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
Remember what I said, you can't...
Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
I love you, John.  I always have.
I know, Mom.  I know.
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
I guess so, sir.
Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?
Why not show Dr. Furtwängler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
No can do.
Three months.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
Von der Null?
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
I have no idea.
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
Okay, so what is it?
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man?  I
How could I know what's in the archive?
Helmuth.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
So. You wanted to see me.
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
The Miracle Kid.
Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
Politics and art must be kept separate. I'll remember that. But let me see if you can help me with something I just don't understand. I'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. What's his secret?
Like this bandleader.
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
I won't let the fat kid down.
I'll do the same for you sometime.
Don't wear the beige one.
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
And you're from the future too?
Defense network computer. New. Powerful.  Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all.  They say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence.  Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side.  Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.
Freezing.
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
I volunteered.
Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me.
I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
Cover...our footsteps...
The year 2027?
Yes.
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
Who is in authority here?
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
What?
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
What are you talking about?
How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.
Never mind.
If there was one.
You pull me up.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Right.  Call me Christy.
They said five hundred.  I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit.  I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
Yeah.  First Communion.  Aren't I a little angel?
What's wrong?
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
All I mean is... someone like you...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
Underwear?
They'll be wanting it back.
About me?
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
This isn't an escort service?
Call them.  Trust me.
I'm going to call.
Do it for YOU.
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
How do you know?
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
Split it?
Have you gone to the police?
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
Oh... it's a game.
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
I'm not sure.
Not much, I think.
You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
No.
Don't ask.
I checked it personally.
What about the house?
What?
<u>Every</u> year is a good year.
Greetings.
Go ahead.
He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
But if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results.  The deception is minor.
Well... we're glad to have you.
Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
All right...
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
It was.
Why?
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
Mary came with me.
Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
That's why we're here.
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
I do.
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
Just had to be sure.
Then let's go get you one.
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
It's not a knock.
It's not a compliment.
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
Why?
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
Because --
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
Fuck you.
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
I dunno ... Maybe they do.
You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife and screamin' kids.  I still got my youth.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
Five years, I think.  Long time.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
First in, first out, that's me.
He's gotta know why.
You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will?  What more do you want, man?
Well, those are the breaks.
You just cooking then?
Hard to miss.
You look alike.
Been busy, have you.
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
It was the bars, then.
Weren't you on a television series?
Not embarrassed.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
My employer.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
Right.
Have you ever known me not to be.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
How do you know?
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
You sure?
Could do, yeah.
I got half.
The forever kind.
Good luck.
That don't mean nothin'.
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
Jennifer Wilson.
Since when?
I don't want you here, Terry.
Are you finished?
Ah.
Of course, you know, Doris had nothing to do with it. Nothing at all.
We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
No. Uh... family friend.
Uh--
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
No. I--tell me--
I'll have it in a week.
You're out of line, mister.
Yeah.
Mm.
...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day.
Uh-huh.
What is it, Dave?
How much to they want, Dave?
Mm.
What happened to you?
You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
I knew we'd pay for it.
Yeah.
So--
I'm fine. Thanks.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
How d'ya like them apples?
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
Uh-huh.
What'd he say?
Hello, Walter.
Crane. Ed Crane.
You also have an interest in the securing property?
Hello.
Sure. Can Ed come too?
Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.
I'll go down and speak to him.
Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
I'll do it.  Just let me find my portable phone.
Let's go!
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
Like hell!
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
Unfortunately, no.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
Oh shit.
Right.  The entire brain appears to have been extracted.  May I see it, please?
What are they?
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
Footsteps!
What do you do?
Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
What?
Frock's been fired.
So what?
Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
I don't understand.
Would you mind showing it to me?
Behind me.  Over there.
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
It's scared of me.
The answer's right in front of us.
Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
A window onto the human condition?
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
<i>You</i> were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch.
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
No.
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
Did something happen today?
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji.  Is that it?
What?!
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
I've tasted other cocoas.  This is the best.
You're the one talking to the walls!
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
Things always do--when you look back.
There's no one here.
--How do you know about that?
I don't understand.
Sorry. Don't have one.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
No, they don't.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
And if it's unsuccessful?
There are complications.
What did it look like?
Did you find something?
You're looking for a bomb.
I just did. You're buying.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
No.
Is that what you'd like me to do?
Evidence of a massive infection.
No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
-- of what exactly?!
Been where?
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
I don't know.
I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
Where are we?
Well, call General McAddie.
And they want to blame us?
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
Where's Scully?!
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
Baked in a pie.
I know.
I know him.
Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
A kingdom.  His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear.  A horrible primitive ugly thing.  I don't want to talk in here.
As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes.  He makes Julia real for me.
This is Stargher we're talking about?
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
I can't leave him!
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
's broken.
I'll get her...
Absolutely.
I doubt that.
Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
What about the cat?
What else do we do?!
That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die.
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
No, no...oh...excuse me.
I was told there were only two men there.
Tell me more.
It's all right.
Yes.
Let's not get into any more trouble.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
I saw him today.
No.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
Pin it on a...
It wasn't petrol.
A bruised lip.
I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
I can't. He disappeared...
Thank you. Excuse me.
Fifty yards right down there.
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
Oh, Mr. Martins...
I'll look it up for you.
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
No, a major, were you really?
Is that what you say to people after death? "Goodness that's awkward..."
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
Tough...tough...Don't worry, old man, they won't hurt her.
You can help her.
As long as they can use you?
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
Yes. The man who helped carry him.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Coming to the point, please.
Yes, sir.
I was told that he did not die at once.
Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
The Roumanian?
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Well make it your business.
Why no, Mr. Martins.
His name?
Okay.
I thought he'd be here to meet me.
Help you out?
Just five dollars, please.
Thanks.
We're ok.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
Exactly.
No one follows that midrash.
I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror....
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
They had Sabra and Shattila.
Why'd we have to leave so fast?
I don't, but...
People still need values, beliefs....
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
Bigger and better.
Why won't you talk to me?
No.
Why not?
Yeah, it's stupid.  Put it on, or I won't teach you.
Don't curse in front of it.
You shouldn't.
Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
You don't own this place.
Lina, the Thousand-Year Reich barely lasted a decade.... Do you really want to go down that road again? In America of all places, where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues...
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
They're liars and cowards.
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Give me a reason not to.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
I don't do that.
Don't tell me what I --
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
What part of Germany are you people from?
From the Rhineland originally.
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
Isn't it true?
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
Why me?
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
Of course.
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
Hello!
Congratulations.
You'll be lovely, but no thanks.  Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
It isn't lit yet.
I didn't say...  Brussels!
Enzo...
Yes, I know.
They say I'm like Lazarus.  You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
Everything about what?
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
... Yes.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
Uh... Yes, of course!
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
You are the father.
Anything.
Positive, Sir.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
What?
No, no.  It's true.  When I was in New York, oh boy!  Before my accident, you understand? 
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
In the spring when he melts!
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.
About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole.
I know sir. I won't let you down.
What do you want me to do?
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
C'mon follow me.
Oh. Okay.
Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Let's get in your truck.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ——
Oh, that's so interesting!
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
More or less.
But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
All right -- the dead, then.  In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
Then you found the leopard --
To know where that leopard went - — I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little fresh—water college back East. I gave that up.
That was unfortunate.
That was a calamity!
It's not for me.  I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.
No. He was kidding Charlie.
I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
That might depend on where you’re going.
I work here, sir. I’m here most of the time.
Couldn’t Nazi hunters do the job?
Who is Friedman?
The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
I’ve had a long and unpleasant day. I’m tired and I’m angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leon’s boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why haven’t you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.
One just doesn’t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
I don’t.
Something like that.
Where is that?
Should I?
To get me killed...?
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brother’s not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
The staff don’t know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldn’t take any more...
Can you tell me how you spell...
Europe...  France. I’m French but I live in London...  ... England.
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didn’t have any. I used a British passport. My name’s not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it won’t be for a couple of hours.
I wouldn’t mind. Thank you.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
Who knows. Who cares...  You wanted slime. You got slime.
I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
No. You’re looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there.  Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit...  Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say?
I saw the ad at George’s.  I’m passing through town and I’m in a hurry.
Why?
What?
The company. We all work for the company.
Just me...  Martin’s gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
La what?
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy’s education.
Jah...
Is my money in there?
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
You’re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guy’s not one of Friedman’s...
‘Le Mercury’. Newman street. Ask for Peter.
Oh. This is... We’d arranged to meet tonight and I’m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Yes. You wouldn’t know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn’t appeal to you...
Oh. That’d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Viens.
Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.
Le montage, l’emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors’ stuff. How much would it cost me?
I think you’d rather not know what I think.
Don’t tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as “Never Forget”. Over the years we’re talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Alright, whatever -- but since He's not going to come down and cut it himself, at least let someone cut it properly!
They've started the battle without me!
What... what do you mean?
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
To marry you.
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
Not yet!
Good.
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
But that was her order!
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
Scared of a girl?
Where... where am I?
Guess.
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
Who are you?
In a village called Domremy.
How old are you?
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
No... I want to be confessed.
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
Buying her?
Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
You think?
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
So how would you put it?
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
His face.
Good.  Where are the English?
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude.
The wind will be with us!  Do as I say.
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
Good idea...
Perfectly.
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
To hell with your voices -- it's time to face facts!  We have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you.  You should go home, Jeanne.
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
Here -- take this instead.
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
Were the men confessed?  Where are the priests?
It's not possible...
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Why would they?
No, I...
No...
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
What... does he... look like?
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
He's still a doctor.
Wladek, please.
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
What are you doing?
How will we sleep?
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
Yes, please.
That makes a change.
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
Yes, that's why I brought it.
Yes, but what good did it do?
What good? Wladek, I'm surprised at you. They died with  dignity, that's what good it did. And you know something else?  Now the Poles will rise. We're ready. We'll fight, too. You'll see.
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
But I want to help, I want to.
Not this week.
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night.
Where are we going?
We're getting out.
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
To be deaf?
Oh indeed. Cotton'.
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
I'll be back.
Someone died here. It's tapu.
Nothing just yet
No.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
You mean in signs?
They are washed.
It's quite safe, they are managing...
Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened?  He get ya with the knife?
Here.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
I think it's the best...
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
Then why ain't he dead?
Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
He was a con man, wasn't he?
I like griftin'.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Mottola.
Hackers.
Good lad.
Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.
You sober?
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
See and raise five.
Raise 5,000.
The name is Lonnegan.
Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
I'll square it with the fixer.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
But what about all these other people?
2:00 A.M.
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger.  I want you to help me break him.
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
I am after this race.
Oh, Jesus.
No.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion.  Counterfeiting, anything you want.
I'll make parole.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
He was?
It's the same one.
And if it isn't?
Don't cry.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
You're talking like a crazy person,
Why not?
Give it to me.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
No.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
And I'll give then proof!
What do you mean?
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye.
Why... in the heart.
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Don't lie to me.
And he still wants to marry me!
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
Who's your candidate?
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
Let's go and see.  Taxi!
This is enough for me.
Could this be him?
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties.
That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth.  Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth.  All right.  Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
I don't like him.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
What bonds?
That's all right.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
Hello, baby.
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
Six Martinis.
Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
Take it easy.
Santa Claus.
Yes.
Maybe a drink would help you.
No thanks.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Did I give it to you?
Your guess is as good as mine.
All right, hard guy.  Get up and bleed on the rugs.
But Wynant --- ?
Sure I will.
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
Got a nice evening dress?
I've got a lulu -- why?
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
I wish you'd tell me.
You his wife?
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right -- 
Turn the car around.
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.
Oh, God.
We're going to keep driving.
Wha...
Yeah.
We're not going to find anything standing here.  Let's get to climbing.
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
Then get up and do something about it.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
It's a combat action.
Then step aside.
And let me guess who is.
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
Wes--
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
OH MY GOD!
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
Wh-what do you think--
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
You can't tell anybody about this.
...I know.
I heard it.
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
Shut up and listen!
Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
Something like that.
We're not going to do anything.
He's not going to leave us.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
Wes is dead!
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
He'll slow down.
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
Saddam's got a boil on his ass?
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
Yeah, you're funny.
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
Yeah, well, we're not.
We got to get out of here.
...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
He lived through that?
triple three, triple three! easy.....
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
Permant cortex bond.
See if you can get a reading on tactal retention.  Try to estimate it without a meter reading.
Too low.
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
I was lost.
No, I...
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
No......  She's dead THX........
Yes.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
We've got one hour. Are you coming or not?
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
Yep.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
You don't have to talk about it.
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
Would you?
Right.
We work fast enough for you?
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
We've created a monster.
Thank you.
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
A ticking bomb...
Nothing so far.
Look, it's important.
C'mon, it's a quiet night.
You don't fish.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
What?
Sir, I--
Goddamit, Reilly--
Yes, sir.
You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I'll need your badge and your weapon.
And it had diamonds in the back.
About tonsils.
You've never been in Constantinople?
Yes!
Like it?
Yes, Baron.
Two weeks and three days.
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
I don't <u>know</u>, M'sieu Giron!
What is it?
M'sieu Monescu!
But you came. And you must forget everything--  except that you are here, Countess.
No--no.
Disappointed?
You're very welcome.  Countess, believe me, before you left this room I would have told you everything ... And let me say this with love in my heart-- Countess, you are a thief.  The wallet of the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine is in your possession. I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket.  In fact, you tickled me.  But your embrace was so sweet ... 
Yes! Don't you remember the day you took that Chinese vase from the Royal Palace  and made it into a lamp for my night table?
What?
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
What time is your rendezvous?
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
You like that statue?
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
Peaches and cream.
But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.
What?
Yes!
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
And so will M'sieu Giron.
Correct!  Good night.
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
<u>Shut</u> <u>up</u>--<u>kiss</u> <u>me</u>!  Wasting all this marvelous time with arguments! 
Then why do you want to go?
Because I want to make it tough for you.
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
Naturally not!
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
Because I hate him--because I love you!
The pumps --
An hour, two at most.
Thank you, Rose.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
Sure. Count me in.
Good. Settled then.
You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!!  Capito?? I go to America!!
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
Bollocks.
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
Excuse me.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.
Could I speak to you in private?
You're welcome. Rose.
So don't marry him.
No, no! Just with her hands.
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
Just move with me. Don't think.
Kinda like we're doin' right now -- uh oh!
It's okay. I'm alright.
Now it's worse.
I'm so cold.
I can't feel my body.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
Would you like anything?
I should like to see my drawing.
Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship.  See the date?
Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
Charmed, I'm sure.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
I can explain--
Glad to see you again.
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Get moving--
If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink. 
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
Want to take it back?
Nice lines--
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
Well--breakfast?  Lunch?
Brett is the name.
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
But--
Sally--!
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
Jimmy!
Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
Not a chance.
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Partners, ain't we?
Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
Three Jacks.
Why isn't that a good time to quit?
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
No--not quite.
Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.
Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
Your wife knows that, don't she?
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
Back is in New York.
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
Knots!
All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
--And he has sex appeal.
No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
No!
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
What's the matter?
Aren't the roses beautiful?
Let me look at it.
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Well I'm not so go home.
I asked where you got him.
Come and get him.
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
No...
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
And you must be Ringo.  Look, Darling, Johnny Ringo.  The Deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say.  What do you Think, darling?  Should I hate him?
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
What?  But I saw 'em-
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
I know.  Me neither.
He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
I know what it means.
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Well sure, neighbor, easy to say.
I think I'll just lie down awhile
Just thinkin' out loud.  Forget it.
Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
Hey!  Virgil!  My God!  Morgan!  Hey, Boy!  You look great!  Both of you!
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
Sure...
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours. Until then, I'm imposing my own electronic silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to NATO, the press, the CIA.  ...And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters, I want him to go along as an observer. Are we agreed?
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
And still not a thing to watch.
Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
- We all want what we can't have?
To the best of my recollection, Mr. Bond, I suggested no such thing.  In fact, I was never here.
Come on. I know better than that -
Not from forty feet.
Does it work on cash machines?
We work in the dark. We do what we can.
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
He was my father's best friend!
No. I'm going with you.
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
... We have time for that?
Now.
No.
The Queen invited you to dinner -
Fueled and waiting.
Maybe. Maybe not.
You always got something to say.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
I told her I would if she would give me time.
Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
Son, I can take everything you got with that deck. It is marked. Now I'm going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere.
You're always taking his side.
It would be nice.
No, I'm too hot now.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
How is the garden doing?
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
Only if you can spare it.
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
Those boys never did have good luck.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Well, you and your husband are special. Ya, Gideon tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor.
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Oh, yeah!
What?  What is it?
Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
Watch yourself!!
Excuse me.
No, you can't.
You can't!
All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
You mean that happy child?
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
Shhh!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
Murderer!
Oh no, Hannah!
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
You are a liar!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
He got it, Woody!
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
I can't quite make out -- 

See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
But you're Irish!
There's no mirror.
I carried you up to your bed.
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
Go away.
You're not so old yourself!
Living with him put years on me.
Ah, come on now!
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Do you think we should take her up to bed?
So did I.
I mean, did you ask her?  What kind of drugs has she tried?
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
You will believe me, because it's true.
That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children.
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
What?
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
Me, too.
Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
Oh, it is?
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
I don't know.
Hi.
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
I don't know.
Like I give a fuck.
Yes.
In school?
He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
Exactly, and this is how I know I'm not getting into business with the U.S. Government.
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
We keep our mouths shut.
No.
We agree.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
What is the name of your informant?
He'll do what I say.
Everybody has a weakness.
It's possible.
Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
Just tell me where she is.
You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  You're a cocky seventeen year-old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away.  And neither does she.
Hey man, back the fuck up.  To this place.  What's that shit?  Right now, all over this country, a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see, You got any drugs?  You know where I can get drugs?  What kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person, on their possibilities?  If you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood, Indian Hills, and they asked every white person they saw, hey, you got any drugs?, within a day, your friends and their kids would be selling. It's market forces, man.  The product's marked up three hundred percent.  You can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day.  You think white people would still be going to law school?
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
What do you mean?
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
You've stabbed me, man.
Ninteen.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Can you not go yourself.
I'm a fugitive from the law. I can't be seen on the fucking streets. Now watch my lips. Kempton Park. Two-thirty. Five pounds to win. Bad Boy.
Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
What's your name?
Can I see you again?
Certainly not.
Is that a promise, then?
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
The point is, you've got to find something new.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
It's an interesting theory.
Now?
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
No.
No. Me Neither.
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
I don't rate that at all.
What?
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
Why, thank you.
Stick it on my tab.
Sounds great, Swanney.
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
What?
A walk.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
It will be your chariot!
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
Transporter room. Status.
The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, "Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.." The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in.  Doctor, if you please.
Goodnight, Bones.
An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
He did have pointed ears.
Is what possible?
"c."... "k."
Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
The ship needs its Captain.
I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
You haven't told him?
Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
I know, I met him.
I want to go to his place.
Of what?
I'm certainly not.
Right on the money!
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
Flynn?
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Well, isn't it -- ?
I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...?
You're alive!
Not us, I hope.
How about you?
Let's get some power here.
How 'bout yourself?
As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
End of line.
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady.  You never used to lie to me.  But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick me up at eight.  The de-brief is at ten hundred.
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
Okay.  Here she comes.
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.
I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
I wasn't cheating!
I agree.
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Sure.  Say that now.
Yeah, it was wild.
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
They must've just missed me.
I needed to feel alive.  I wanted to do something...  outrageous. And... I don't know... it felt good to be needed.  To be trusted.  To be special.
Yes.
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
I don't take those assignments.
She's really a fox, isn't she?
No.  But I wanted to.
So what's your angle?
I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
Worse than Cairo?							*
Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
Yes.  Now go.
Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
Hello, Alabama.
Wait a minute -
Ya looked through it?
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
What time is it?
No. Not particularly.  How come?
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
Burt Reynolds.
Do you have a fella?
I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
What?
What?
Write down Drexl's address.
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
What?
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
You wanna get unhaunted?
I'm a married man.
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
What's this acting class guy's name?
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
Two guys.
Um, nothing, let's go?
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
What department?
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
Yeah?
Me too, Boris.
That's about all I ever eat.
No shit?
Nope.
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
What are you talkin' about?
What about him?
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
Shit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a nigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there lately.
Exactly room-mates.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
You're still a little... disoriented.
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
Change what?
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
I have to go.
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...
Lock it now!
Shot!  Who shot you?
I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
You're sure?
I thought I was in...prison again.
I don't know -- I don't remember.
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
What's that mean?
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
I couldn't call!  You sent me to the wrong year!  It was 1989.
You're insane, Jeffrey.
Negative for drugs.  But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?
What?  What did you say?
You want something, old man?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
Next city you're in take it to a jeweler.  He won't give you less than four-hundred for it.
That's my morning's pay.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
What?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
Open up!
What do you want?
They look nice.
Uh-huh
There's someone in the house.
I'm just going to my car.
That's right on my way.
I got it.
That's all right.  I got it.
I . . . can't . . . argue . . .
You're welcome, Grace.
A medicine man?
Those are white words, not ours.
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
You could just leave him.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Take me with you.
I wanted to talk.
Because I know you're full of shit.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
There has to be!
To get my car.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
Husband . . .?
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
You've got to be--
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
Like you don't know.
I do.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?
Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . .
And tell her what?
You love her, but you hate her?
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
Came close this time and it scares you.
Drop it, Jake.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
A hundred-forty-five really.
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
What?
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
You expect me to believe that?
Stand up.
Oh, shit!
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
You've got to be--
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
That's a bit much.
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
Oz.
But you was going to fight for me.
Get away from me!
You own this place?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Don't look like nothing.
Hundred-fifty.
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
No.
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
You've been around.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Thank you.
I'm guessing no.
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
Kill him.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three...
I busted my leg!
Harlin's.
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
The old lady?
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
No baby, you got it wrong.
They look nice.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
How old is Jeb?
Okay.
It means we're probably to tired to remember.
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Yes. Is this David?
My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
Rust?
What was that?
The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
You've misunderstood.
I don't know what you're asking?
You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
We are.
In under six seconds.  I've heard.
I'm going to work out.
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
All of it.
There's no more left?
You're lying.
This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
No.
How long have you been married?
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
No?
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
Three days? I must be.
Yeah, I guess.
Property.
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
You were there?
Did you... kill him?
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
What?
I could of... easy.
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
Well... I don't recollect.
Yup.
Yeah.
How I said I shot five men... it wasn't true.  That Mexican... the one that come at me with a knife... I busted his leg with a shovel... I didn't shoot him or nothin'.
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
I could tell you who was last, mister.
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
This Kid, what's he like?
You ain't like that no more.
You ain't like that no more.
Hell, no. I'm just a fella now. Ain't no different from anyone else no more.
Sometimes... yeah.  I don't miss it all that much.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
Best we move that pig.
Thought you was followin' me.
You gonna share your half with him?
Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
More.
Plenty of times.
He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
We'll bury him.
Yeah?
There's more.
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
I'm having a stroke.
Dig.
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
Tough break.
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Fenster and Hockney?
What time is it?
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
Neither do we.
You're lying.
We want to meet him.
Someplace else, then.
Waste of time.
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
You know damn well what I think.
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
Keaton was a piece of shit.
I just want to hear your story.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.  After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
This is totally irrelevant.
I never heard of him.
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
... tell me about this case.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
We went to Code Blue...
Your Honor...!  Your Honor...
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
I'm just an M.D.
How is that?
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
How old are you?
Yes.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I...
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
And you wrote that...
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
Nothing happened.
Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
I'm sure you would.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
Mr. Alito, please.
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent.
We find that your subscription lapsed...
Missus...
Still looking.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Yes.  It was, actually.
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
And are they going to get it?
That's what I'm going to try to do.
What happened...?
You're going to stay here...?
Stop pressuring me...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you.  I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file.
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
Oh shit, what's today?
What difference can that make...? All right...
The broad has disappeared...
The Hospital...?
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
... I'm sure you do ...
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
She did?
You saw Kat in New York...   ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
Four.  You're great with these kids.
Mrs...
I used to be a nurse.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
I did.
Yes.
As I've said we had some more...
That Frank was working on.  Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror.  So Franky finds out.  He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint.  I told him ' Franky, wake up.  These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from?  Doing good?'  He can't be comforted.  He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
He won't talk.
You don't have to do it for a living.
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
What about?
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Salina, Kansas!
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
Yes.
Please! And don't look at me.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
I loved you, Madeleine.
Where were you?
I... didn't know where you lived.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
Meet again, sometime.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
How can you be sure?
The oldest living things?
Have you been here before?
No, don't ask me!
What was it inside that told you to jump?
Yesterday.
Would you know the room?
I know.
Why?
Yes... you run this hotel.
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
I'm having one now.
That's following a train of thought.
Sorry, old man. Work.
What do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge?
Okay.
You haven't told me everything.
Out. I've got things to do.
Oh... this and that.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
Well that's what I said.
First of all...
Franco mother-fucking Harris!
Playing?
Why was the floor wet?
The hell you do.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
I'm not getting a ticket.
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Alright. Let's do it.
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
Any time fat boy!
Nobody's smoking anybody out.
I don't give a damn.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
They're singing.
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
What happened? Oh my God...
Where's the bathroom?
There's more.
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
He's having a problem here.
He is not cracking up.
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
You need help.
I never heard that.
And what happens when you can't?
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
How about my Fatburger?
I do.
Florist?
Why what?
How could I know what else I forgot?
Don't you dare.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
Problems?
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Do you love me?
Just a bit of organizing.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
What money?
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
No...
I love you dad.
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
I don't think that's a good idea.
Give them to Refugio.
Enedina and Paco ...
You see, even the voice.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
Fifteen yards.
What are you going to do?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
And do you know that my mother and I had to suffer? If my father had bothered himself a little more about us, I'd be an architect now.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
A black bull!
Yes!
I can't do anything to make you stay? These people annoy you, isn't that it?
I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
That will soon pass. It's nothing.
He was a computer program for crissake.
I'm getting by.
If you can catch him.
Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do.
Not from in here.
How do you know I won't run?
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
I was assured the problem was corrected.
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
I understand... I understand perfectly.
I haven't been working on anything.
This is supposed to be years away.
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
Of course you are.
Help me get out of here.
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
Stop me.
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
That's why I'm asking.
Duck!
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to...
...twelve years.
What rig?
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
What would do that...?
It's going to be fine.  It's going to be ... you remember in 88, when...
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
...you want us to go to War...
Precisely.
Wilfred.  We've got <u>work</u> to do...
...this's <u>good</u>...
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
How long you been up, you need a nap.
You're tired, Ronnie.
What are we gonna <u>do</u> about it...?
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
And I think that the Security of the Country would be best-served by its citizens obeying its laws.  Gemme a Federal Judge, gemme search-warrants, all premises controlled by our friends, and bench-warrants for the two of...
Where's my pill...?
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.
...what is this?
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
Why do people go to war?
Why do people go to war?
That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>,
...going to War...
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
They got to have something that we want.
"Freedom."
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
...we'll gettim in their cars.
Uh...
Speaking of that...  We're gonna need a whole lot <u>more</u> of this....
Leav't alone.  Wha'd television ever do to you?  Ate your <u>life</u>, ruin'd your <u>Culture</u>, but...
Get on your feet, boy.
Uh huh...why?
Ha ha.  No, no, not <u>now</u>, not <u>now</u>, of course, But Someday... when they tell <u>this</u> story...
It's a <u>beret</u>...
Isn't Johnny Green in the... 
You like it?
I'm just talking about the Hats.
Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
Why...?
Is it a <u>stream</u>, or is it a...
They don't know what's going on!
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
Oh really.
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
It concerns his future!
Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.
Speak English will ya.
Coulda been a contender.
It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
What are you doing here?
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
What if he asks where I got the money?
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
"What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
Okay.
All right, Bud... let's do it.
Jackson, Steinem...
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
What? How do you know about my father?
Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business...
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Dump it.
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
Oh yes, I remember you.
Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
Where is it?
Upper West Side.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
Break it.
Only if I want something bad enough.
Yeah, almost...
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
Oh Christ!
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
I can't...and I won't.
I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
Hi
Too late for that sir.  Give my love to the misses.  Get those bastards!
She went to a waxwork party
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
Hi there Sarah
Sell my soul?
Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing victim, you can bring him back to life!
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.
Then we both are.
Nope.
I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
Yes, but...
You think you influenced her?
No.
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
Who?  Your husband?
And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
Wait!  Don't go...
And these roses.  They're much prettier up close.
It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened.
Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
I didn't sleep with him.
I came in from my room...
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
Good.  I'm good.
Well good.  So you're human.
You're discussing me with your psychic?
So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
...no...no...no...
This.
I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Relieved?
Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
I don't know...
Three weeks.
No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
You know what I mean.
You are...
Shhh.
After that.
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
What kind of whispering?
You're kidding.
Did you tell her?
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
When?
Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
I never said...
Claire, please...
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
I felt you...looking through me...
The...
Yes.  The ghost.
It's Madison Fra--
What's the matter?
It's too rough.
Claire--
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
To Caitlin!!
It's alright.
She can't be here without me.
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
Don't think so.
Shhhh.
MADISON!
:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
Nothing was ever more false.
C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
Eighty million doll --- ?
Stop it!
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
You - are - a - murderer.
Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
Now, lasher - it is our time.
FAST.
He's herniating!  Forget OR.  He's dead batore he's oft the elevator Get me a trephine tray -  Anesthesia - stat!  We need him intubated and blow down!
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
Doctor's orders- - -?
Captain's orders.
God knows, I'm intriguing.
- a witch.
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
I've come home, Michae1, for the first time.  I want to stay here - with you.
Their what...?
Your beneficence.
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
No.
You can't just -
Just don't fall off any ladders.
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
I'm sorry - I didn't think
Yes it is...
No - not all the time - I mean
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
And how many people have you killed?
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
I don't know...
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
Yes - I suppose so...
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
Is LESLIE here?
He saved my life you know - has he told you...
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
Don't worry about it -
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
Yes, that would be nice - I'll call round some time...
INSPECTOR DAVE TAYLOR - Scotland yard ...Can I have a word?
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
I'll be sure to...
That's crazy talk.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
Yeah, whatever.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
Ladies first.  I insist.
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
I mean, what do you think?
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
I guess.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
Want a lesson?
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
Hi ho, Silver.
Hmmm?
What do you want me to do?
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
Very funny.
You want it in writing?
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
I'm trying to help.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
Then I'll write about YOU.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
What about you?
I see.
Maybe someday.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
Let your fingers do the walking.
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
It's okay, Mom.  Trust me.
Forget the store. Think big.
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
You called the cops on us?
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
Why, look who's here.
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
What about the blood?
And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
I know you do.
All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
Unless what?
Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?  What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
Why is that?
What was that?
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
I'm sorry?
No!
Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
A ride.  You want one?
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Curiosity, I guess.
No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
Just like that?
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Yeah, or get me drowned.
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Always hoping.  Or this...
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
All what?
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
That's right... That's good.
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
My pleasure.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
You most certainly do.
I don't like to lose, either.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
And?
He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
No, sir... just a businessman.
Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
Who was this partner of his?
When are they coming?
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
No.  I mean yes.
I don't believe you.
I will!  But I need help!
Good.  How long will it take?
The Fairy Queen?  And the baby here's a princess?  And these two rodents are your guides?
You?
I won't.
Watch it!
Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it.
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
The art of transformation!
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
Now use it.
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
More!  More!
You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
Just do it!
Surrender!!
Ouch!  Let go of me!
I changed her already!
Madmartigan.
You're the guardian, aren't you?
How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
Not one this big.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
John, why?...
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Are they going to kill you?
Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
No you're not –  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
But why?
But –
But... You may not be well enough.
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens –
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Oh.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
I will be the judge of that.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
No... No. It is just the English way.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Are you all right, Dorothy?
Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
Oh, now?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
No, they won't - honestly.
Me?
No --
My mouth -- my mouth!
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh --
You've had plenty of time already!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Not nobody, not nohow!
Supposin' you met an elephant?
I'd sooner wait outside.
But why?  Why?
Because I'm still scared!
I think I'll miss you most of all.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
Ohh!
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
Yes --- there.
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
Fine.  He's got a plan
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
No, her dog!
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
It's no use screaming at a time like this! Nobody will hear you!  Help!
I can fairly hear my heart beating!
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
It's a whozis?
Well, I --
Who’s she?
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.
It’s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
A word? I’m sure by now he’s engineered a hostile takeover.
He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don’t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I’m not sure he knew that.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
It’s the only way out...
I have to go.
Then take me with you.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
I don’t know what you’re talking about!
He used your exact words.
Not interested.
You turned Renard.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
No!  Get me out!
Your father...
Of course...
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
We don't know that.
Veidt¹s complex.
Good night.
I¹m not.
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
Maybe not, but why take chances?
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
Where did he go?
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
What do you mean, frame-up?
-- What?
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
What do I get out of it?
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
"Anarchy" 99"?
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
He gets to be the hero.
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
Go to hell.
Mind your business.
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
Go to hell!
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
Aren't you afraid?
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
You're serious?
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
Here we go again.
First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
He's a pretty good actor, though.
Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
Beast.
For what purpose?
If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
We have to find Magneto.
He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
Into the Hudson?
Suit yourself.
Yeah, I'll bet you have.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
What did she do to me?
What do you want with him?
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
What?
MMmmm.
MMmmm.
Hello...?
Miss me?
Yes.
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
I hope you like large weddings.
Darling!
Love me?
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
Yes?
How old are you, young man?
But, sir...
You must be Igor.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
What wockers?
Did you hear that strange music??
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
Must be the music room.
Funny it should just be lying out here on the table.  I wonder what kind of dribble this is?
I have a pretty good idea.
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
What?
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
I'm not trying to be funny.
No, no!  That whole thing!
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
That sound good, boss.
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
MMMmmmmmmmm.
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
Inga, wake up!
Well, this explains the music.
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!
I think I'll...carry him.
Yes -- quickly, dear!
Are you serious??
We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
But, after all, you have yours.
Yes, I know.
Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.
Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
