You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
You have my word.  As a gentleman
What crap?
Great
It's more
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
What's normal?
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
You set me up.
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
Wear the belly before you go.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
You know French?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
What 're you talking about?
Where ya goin?
Leave my sister alone.
You need money to take a girl out
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I just upped my price
Do what?
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You and Verona?
I didn't have a choice.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why'd you let him get to you?
Dorsey.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Then why'd you ask?
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
No.
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
My grandmother's .
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Because I like to torture you.
I know.
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
So what I want doesn't matter?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
You think?
Macbeth, right?
I missed you.
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
Absolutely not.
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
What is it, now?  Tell me...
Viceroy of the West Indies.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
Chief knows.
Chief says -- he has a God.
Father Marchena!
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Colon!
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
I knew you would.
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
What do you read?
What's he doing?
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
Then why?
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
I'll make some for us.
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
It was my decision, not his.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Chief - mind if I take her?
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Only one guys checked in?
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Pretty.
What would you call her?
Of course.
My point exactly.
So am I.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
What do you want?
Detective, does it look like a murder?
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Answer the phone.
Yeah.
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Okay, til tonight.
Ready?
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Where's your partner?
Yes.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
What?
Speak English!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
What is it?
It's easy to learn.
Yeah?
Yes...he's my friend.
I'll send a cop back for you.
I used an accelerant.
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
How long they been livin' here?
How was it?
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
It's possible.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
That seems very unlikely.
But not completely inconceivable?
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
CONTINUED
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Fortunately, they did.
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Thank you.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
That's true
Yeah?
Vodka.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
Pay money?
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
Hello, again.
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
What do you think?
We eat when I say we eat.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
Just tell me about the money.
What?
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Jack?
I lost them, that's what happened.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
When? How?
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
Whaddya think?
Keep stallin'.
Let her go.
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five.  On credit.
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
No thank you.
What kind of mission?
And then?
They really made her...
Who?
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Eto Akta Gamat!
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
...Hello?
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Love...
Apipoussan!
Here we go again...
You noticed..
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
I'm so tired...
...Like love...
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
I want your best man on this!
They just landed in the desert.
Perfect, Mr. President.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Am I disturbing you?
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
How's the detective business?
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
Hello?
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
You couldn't?
What are these?
Dino...
And they are?
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
Yeah, who's this?
I'm gonna kill you.
I don't know...
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
Tell me what happened.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Give me the film.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Alright, I get the picture.
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
Nothing remotely like this.
Okay...
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
How will I get it to you?
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
I had to ask.  I apologize.
Do you think the police did a good job?
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
Extra money, huh?
Not really.
Been up with Alice.
What is it?
She doesn't want me around
The tickets.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
I'm so sorry, honey...
How was the meeting?
I've got to go.
But how are we gonna --
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Yeah...
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
So?
'Us?'
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Are you alright, Wade?
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Who?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
What are you boys up to?
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
How soon?
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Yes.
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
You see it?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
What happened?
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
In the chest.
Yeah.
Open the door, will ya?
Open the door. We're late.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
You know.
I guess they're stupid.
But it's not funny now.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
Dad.
It belongs to Pop.
Nothing.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Okay.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
Where's the plow?
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
On what you pay me?
So?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Maybe.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
Said what?
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
What way?
How?
This is nuts.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
You're not using it today?
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Who are you?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
Where... how'd you hear that?
Sleeping.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
In the living room.
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Huh?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Yeah, I guess.
What about her?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Find them everywhere. 
Which is?
Then who shot him?
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Yeah.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
Alice...
I'm sorry, honey.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
Oooooh, I'm good.
How was...  ...the ballet?
It's cut.
How we doing, Colonel?
Sir, you threw out page two.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
We're not going to make it.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
Leave my daughter alone.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Twenty minutes?
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
You know what?
I don't know why you stayed.
Where's my family?
who can I say is calling?
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
Shepherd.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
Forget it.  I was reading.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Elaine.
Ted, what's wrong?
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
Who's that, Ted?
Ted, we're taking off!
Ted.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Simon.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
I think so.
Negative.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Sixteen 'C', why?
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
You can't go in there!
Don't try to stop me!
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
Ted!
Ted, what are you doing here?
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
The cockpit? What is it?
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
Lay off, asshole.
Yes...
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
He didn't recognize me.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
Yes.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Did you talk to him?
Screw you.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
Stop the car.
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
What was that about?
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
How potent?
We all did.
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Can't lock up...
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
Is she...?
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
You son of a bitch.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
What is it?
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
Ellen.
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
You're just reading me.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Range twenty meters.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Why not?
They're dead.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
No, it's different, honey.
Did you ever have a baby?
Mommy...Mommy?
Are we going to sleep now?
Look, I told you...
How many colonists?
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
His Grace is very angry with you.
Maestro.
Is there a part for me?
Where?
What does he look like?
Is she a good fuck?
Humiliated?
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
What is it?
Why?
No! No! No!
That's stupid.
Em iram! Em iram!
Ui-vol-i-tub!
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Well, don't do that again!
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
What are you doing here?
This is not his handwriting.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
How much will you pay him?
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
Money! Money!
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
What a strange young man.
Just one year.
Who was your teacher?
What a charming idea. May I see?
May I try it?
Your Majesty!
Majesty!
Yes, indeed.
And German?
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
What is it?
Would you tell me why?
Well, what do you have for me today?
Yes, what about him?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
No one calls you that.
Father -
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Where?
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
What for?
I'm sorry. No.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
What happened? Is it over?
The doctor thinks I am. But -
No! No, it's him!
Finish what?
Of course.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Confutatis Maledictis.
I think so.
That's wonderful!
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
Exactly. A dance.
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
A little modesty would suit you better.
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Herr Mozart -
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Do you hear me?
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
What?
Yes.
I poisoned his life.
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
I've seen the manuscript.
About the ballet.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Bene.
What happened to them?
What shall we do?
Aw come on, Miss Price!
Aw come on, Alex!
Now what do you want to talk about?
What? Oh, yes, please.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
I'm sorry I woke you up.
What?
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Tomorrow is the full moon.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
The zoo?
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Now see here young man.
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
Yes.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Hello.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
Jack, we'd better go.
Come on, where?
Oh shit. What is that?
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
I can't stand it.
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
It's you, David.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
What do you think?
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
You were saying?
What here?
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
He has?
Charlie!
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I—
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
What good will that do?
What about?
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I—
What?
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
Let me see your cash book, will you?
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
No. I won't.
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
Yes, sir.
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Yes, sir.
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
No.
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
Oh, ten dollars—
Oh, Charlie again.
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Did you say Dude Finlay?
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
He's smiling.
How?
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
Oh no...
But if we take their money and supplies...
I think I recognize you.
You're not scared, are you?
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
She was European!
Thanks for the help.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
The James-Younger Gang.
What are you saying?
A bad idea.
Missed you, cousin.
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Cannon or Gatling?
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
Jesse.
They gonna rush us?
The safe. Now.
It's a secret.
Web died fighting?
You know him?
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Bob's upset.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
Oh yeah.
Jim was old enough...
Yeah, Jimmy?
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
Don't turn around.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
I figured.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
You been with a girl ever?
I swear.
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
... too young for whisky...
Why, yeah.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Really?
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
Just perfect.
This is him.
You wouldn't have done that?
So he's won.
Stop it. I'm...
On a lot of lithium?
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
Yes, darling?
We should do it.
I don't want to talk about it.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
Listen, what about dinner?
No, he doesn't.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
It's just not.
Lucky, I guess.
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
What's that, a gram?
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Don't, I'll drink it.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
Yes?
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Who?
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Well.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
Don.
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Wait. That's not what I've got.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
Not in the mood, I guess.
Marcus?
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
It's important.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
They hack into people's programs?
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
...Whaddo I do?
Great!
He'll tell me when he gets home.
He wasn't acting?
My goodness.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
You really wrote this just today?
What're you implying.
I'm sure.
You could've handwritten it.
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
Keep looking.
Lisa.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Do we post it on the Net?
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
I told Teddy about you.
What'd he say?
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
She's a programmer?
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Yes.
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Thank you.
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Yes?
Be careful.
What's the other?
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
I beg your pardon?
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
Fancy a nibble?
Watch out, you're on my hair!
Austin, may I have a word with you?
Does that make you horny?
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
Are you crazy?
That's not mine.
Noooooooooooooo!
Is it one of ours?
What are you saying, son?
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
Hi.
An evil vet?
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
He's asleep.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
What about his teeth?
Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
... love...
... love ...
You are female?
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Rules are made to be broken.
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.
I resign.
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
Choices?
Rules are made to be broken.
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
For a man in my position --
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
I could save you the trouble.
Because you always obey orders ...
You're playing games.
I thought you didn't.
You don't trust me?
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
Peter's brother?  But --
I know all this.
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
You're not venturing alone, surely.
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
I feel sure of it.
You with Mother or Father?
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
No, please! I beg you ...
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
That's what we're going to find out...
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
Cole...
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
I love that car.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
Cole?
No, Cole, I...
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Huh? Wha...
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
Yes...
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
What the hell are you doing?
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
Ed... you're kinky!
The phone made me do it!
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
Right in there, pal.
I don't know.
How 'bout this?
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
I don't know.
You know Knowlton pretty well?
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
Not likely.
Hey! You don't know me --
I'm in heaven, Lt.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
It's okay, Stephen, I --
Saw what?
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
You look great.
I work for city hall.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
Arson.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
Homey.
Then why did you quit?
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
Oh Jesus Christ...
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
Yeah.
Your brother was a good man.
Four months?
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
Dad!
Fixing my roof.
Where's Sean?
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
I treated you better.
You want some coffee?
What's wrong?
Anyway, down here, take a look...
Didn't think you'd make it.
Who's this?
Did he tell you how we finally met?
I'm working on it.
You don't know... nobody knows...
"Don?"
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
People.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Yeah.
Nah...
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
All right. What are you gonna do?
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
This psycho can.
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
He gots to be did.
YEAH!
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
Let's go niggers!
Delacroix.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
What are you talkin' about?
De-la-croix.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
Word!!!
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
I'm feelin' dis'!
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Who are the other characters?
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
He never showed it.
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
Why'd you do that?
He, I'm Mona.
Can I kiss you too?
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
The one with da big...
...no, she didn't...
...too early...
...then what about...
...like grits and butter...
You slept too near where you got in?
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
I feel a song a comin' on.
A lot?
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
What?
How did you get this gig?
Say what, Manray?
Don't try to change to the subject.
Where are you bound for?
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
Is Miss Dugan well?
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
Certain?
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
But you refused me, Dorothy.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
Good night, papa.
Yes?
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
Is he all right, papa?
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
He is the only one unaccounted for.
You too?
It's... too slow.
You did Basic here?
There's no need...
I'm not telling you what happened.
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
You saw West's body.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
Do what?
And the bodies?
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
That bad?
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
They got their stories straight.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
No.
What are you talking about?
Oh, you remember now --
So you took off your shirt?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Dunbar says you were.
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
You want Kendall, don't you?
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Sir, yes, sir!
Great, great. That's fantastic.
The poet? What ever happened to him?
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
So I've heard.
I never knew.
Karl.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Okay.
Dad?
Dad!
How what happens?
You say...
I can't imagine any place better than here.
'Fraid so.
We rented a car.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
The sets were good.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
That's not a burn.
What? What are you doing?
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
Good. 
We better watch him. He's crazy.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
When?
What was that?
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Yes.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
I don't understand.
Syevodnya?
So what are you going to do?
I know you just want to punish me --
Have you got your passport?
Shut up. I'm not listening.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
Sometimes neither.
You are throwing me out.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
I don't know.
What was her name?
Oh! Gave me a start.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
Now wait...
YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
Let go...
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Don't... don't say that to me...
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
I don't fuckin' cook.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
How you feelin' today?
What I love.
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
Why you say that?
What'chu sayin'?
What'chu sayin'?
What'chu sayin'?
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
You ever seen a train run on a woman?
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
So...  That your first time?
Yes'sir.
Thank you.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
You a preacher?
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
What happened to your face?
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
Get rid of it.
Frank Abolofia.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene.
Getting very weird.
Squid?
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
Why the hell not?
Ichiro --
She disappeared... shit!
It's illegal, Nick.
Let's go.  Him first.
Yes...
Don't give him any more.
Don't be an ass.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
Where's the wife?
What do you chant?
I don't remember saying yes.
What if I chant?
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
Save it, I already took the tour.
She's such a long way home for you.
I'm amused.
He killed a police officer.
What's this?
You trust me?
With these?
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
That wasn't our deal.
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
He could?
You're our best and only friend.
What's going on down there?
He's not ready yet.
I think, therefore I am.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
She's not with you?
You want to see my friends?
One more, eh?
I'm doing okay.
Let's hear it.
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
You sure?
Why didn't you go?
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
What did she want?
What shows?
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
Are you for real?
Does it eat?
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
I can imagine.
Who is this?
How come you're not on the job?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
Like?
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
Whatcha doin'?
Twenty.
Methuselah Syndrome.
Is that why you're still here?
This is my new friend...
Your mom was a dancer?
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
How do you do?
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
What?!
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
No, I'm lost.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
So far?
Again.
Do you own a car?
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
Over this?
I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
They're all divorced?
One who's not a mutant.
Is this your house?
He has a computer?
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
I'm really sorry!
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
My pleasure.
No.
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
These are wonderful.
What's baseball?
No, son. A pitcher.
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
Right on the button.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Not on him.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
Of what?
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Hello.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
Sorry, Mom!
Right.
I just hope this is still good up there.
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
He drank it hot?
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
You hear that?!
Days??
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
I've noticed.
Get the presents and do the lights.
We do?
I thought ten years.
Stop it, you two!
Well, that's blunt!
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
What's it to you?!
Yes, you do!
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
What's wrong?
I don't know. I like to think so.
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
Wolf One -- say intentions.
I've seen a few.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
Yes.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Is Sandy part of this?
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Shit. You better tell me something.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Don?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
I'm glad you do.
I did. Are you?
I'll call you.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Hold me, Don.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
Hello, daddy.
You want to see him too, right?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
I don't want to go.
Here's to Ben.
What?
Nothing.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
God, you scared me.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
How ya doin' Dad?
How is Central these days?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
Now, how are you going to do that?
Alright.
So, what's next?
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Yeah, but.
Are you sure?
What did you see?
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
You want to go talk to him?
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Where to?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Jeffrey? What's going on?
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Hey, I just...
Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
I can't find the second one, sir.
What?
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
Yeah, well...
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
Mother, is that you?
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
For what?
Where the fuck are you going?
Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
What?
And the pennies?
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
What?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
Oh my god!
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Fuck you!
Liberating isn't it?
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
What the fuck do you mean?
Hello? You there?
Yes.
I believe these young men are right.
Don't do this my son.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Right. The blond guy.
Why?
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Yeah, I saw it.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
You think we're going to be chased?
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Where's the manager?
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
Well, then cut it in half.
What about them?
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
What the fuck is going on here?
Which one was that?
He's gone. He stole the car.
When'd he tell you?
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
I think we better go home.
We've got sixteen dollars.
That's what she is!
What is it?
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
Do you like Inez?
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
How long are they going to hold him?
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
What?  What?
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
That's Anthony.
That's your friend Anthony?
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
That never would of --
What did I say?
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
What the fuck possessed you?
Bob, that makes no sense.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
You don't even know his name.
Yes, I do.
Just get in the car, Bob.
Dignan.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
I never agreed to that.
Scarecrow?
He's having a heart attack or something.
Is he breathing?
Do you have your own cell?
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
Can't get it. It won't... 
We're closed, sir.
I don't know.
The world needs dreamers, son.
What?
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
So what's he doing? You believe him?
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
What do you have, Danny?
And?
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
Jesus...
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
You know I'm not.
Because you're afraid!
Is this really happening?
Felt a little light.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
The Telegraph office.
But you're sure?
What?
-- not yet --
You hear me? I believed you.
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
It's me.
What do you want?
Okay, Jason, your move.
Oh, shit...
Alright... take it down.
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
You're sure?
How long have you worked for the agency?
What kind of problems?
Amnesia?
You mean, did I want a date?
Did you?
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
Anything?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
So I did! And what was so important about it?
No, M'lord.
When will his trial be?
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
A common thief.
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
I have faced him. Have you?
Thank you for accepting.
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
And I with you. But you must wake.
I need you so much! I love you!
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Um... can dad come this time?
You know the answer to that.
Why do you ask?
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
Weirder than this?
What did you see? What did it look like?
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
Dad lives here?
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
I thought you were a December baby.
What the fuck are you doing?
Huh?
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
Where... where are my clothes?
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Different? How?
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
So what's the point?
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
Monsieur Rick?
I came with Captain Renault.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
Here you are.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
It's not for sale at any price.
What do you want for Sam?
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
Not an easy day to forget.
And I was wondering.
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
I don't think I will, Rick.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
Please.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
For the last time, put them on the table.
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
No.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
No, Captain, please.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
It was a combination of all three.
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
He is traveling with a lady.
I have my orders.
Yeah, you were saying?
Oh, how do you do?
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
I would advise you not to interfere.
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
Yeah?
Boss, let's get out of here.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
Save some for tomorrow.
Get up.
No.
You're beautiful.  Marry me.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.
As much as anybody.
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
You?  Personally?
Chuck.
Merry Christmas eve.
Get back?  From where?
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Yes, yes he did.
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
What happened to your pants?
The place is falling apart.
Can you find her?
You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
That's why you're a gambling man.
You are one sick fucker.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
Cool ropes.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
That's all there is.
What?
Only if you can afford it.
He'll need clothes... some money...
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
These *credentials* are against the law!
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
Really?
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
You don't understand! It's her father...
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
I can't go nowhere.
I love you, Wally.
They wanted a girl.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
*Liver* killed him?
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
Have you enlisted?
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
What business is you in, Homer?
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
I'm not in trouble.
But you don't look very happy.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
They told me I was too old to serve.
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
Where do you think you're going?
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
We had to finalize the deal.
Everything looks in order.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
The Anti-Christ?
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
Like what?
I was doing it for them.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
The red hair... It's bad luck.
Shit.
Well, this is just fucking great...
And what about Big Al?
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
Minus one.
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
Sorry, I --
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
Oh Jesus!
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
Mr. King, I think --
And some new clothes.
Lighten up.
It's more than that.
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
Jesus... Take it easy.
What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
So what do you want?
Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?
You trust this Moonan guy?
Why did you quit?
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
I get it.
Good night?
I couldn't resist them.
I've got a job.
It came my way. 450 a week.
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
Are you drunk?
You're entitled to your opinion.
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
Really?
How did you know I was here?
Nothing about you.
Leave me alone, Marion.
I want to buy a car.
Great.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
You're serious.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
Let it go.
Jani! Where are you?
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Ross.
Of course I recognised him!
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Where to?
Where do you live, Jack?
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
Rough day?
I'd like to buy you a drink.
What makes you so sure?
Does he win?
The key!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
Huh?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
Of course.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
But how do you know you exist?
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
Mafhkin oble groop...
Pinback...
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
I need a diameter approximation.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Bruno's girlfriend.
Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
I'm on a break.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
What're you talkin' about?
How come I never hearda you before?
Who's Camille?
Leave.  Now.
Move it.
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
Which is none of your business...or mine.
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
You didn't...
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
What makes you cry?
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
You lost me.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
Your basic hodge-podge.
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
I understand.
Nothing on Hannah?
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
Make the call.
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
No, I mean... you love your son?
What's that?
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
Any luck?
Damn straight we are.
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
Wait! I know how we can get in!
But, mom!
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Is that your final answer?
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Theoretically.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
Where did you come from?
Will you go with me?
Why?
Well...
Who?
Hey. You OK?
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
Do you get to meet Ed?
Where it came from?
Oh, shit!
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
The good stuff.
People get hurt.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
Where are we going, Donald?
What's her name?
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Gerald.
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Frank?
It is a big deal.
What else?
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
There's no rule!
No more fuckin' for her.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
Loretta, never have kids.
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
This came for you, sweetie.
Oh, Amber...
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
Bye mom.
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
I just did.
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
Oh, naw. Hi.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
So? Be real easy.
We was robbed.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Gladys! Stop it!
Uh, Gladys?
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
"My dear President"...
"My dear"...
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
I don't want him.
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
Why wasn't I insulted?
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
Once more! 
You upstart!
Then it's war?
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
I thought everything was working out fine.
Yes please, two.
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
John loves the house.
Yes?
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Treves. Well done.
I could easily arrange...
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
You never mentioned his mental state.
Have you read it?
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
You're English.
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
John... Merrick
Merrick...
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
...Yes potatoes... but...
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
Thank you very much.
That's a canopy, John.
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
My home.
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Fine.
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Very smart indeed.
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
Right! Where is he?
It's your fantasy...
I said welcome.
What's the matter?
Oh, for goodness' sake!
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
Do you believe I love you?
Is it night or day, Erik?
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
No... we don't...
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
I'm sure it's lovely.
He wants to kill US!
Yes... oh, yes...
Have you done this sort of thing before?
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
What -- rape?
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Why?
Is THAT Odin?
"But" what?
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
You talking piffle, son?
I met this girl...
It's always the women that start the trouble.
I want to die...  No, I don't!
SHUT UP!
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
There is another way.
Just say something cheerful.
What are you talking about, Erik?
But HOW?
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
Bye... sorry...
Yeah... well...
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
Can't make enough swords!
That's right.
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
He drove me mad!
May I help you?
Come over after I'm done here?
Oh, baby, what's going on?
Oh, Tangerine.
Well, I didn't want to assume.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Rockville Center.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Joel? It's Joel, right?
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
It's pretty.
Ready for another?
What do you want to hear?
You just say. I'm not really --
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
You'll call me, right?
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
Joely...
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
I remember that speech really well.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
Oh God, how horrid.
I know.
I wish we did. You married?
What are you doing?
When?
Oh, um...
I'm nervous, too.
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
Guess what I'm wearing.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
I should maybe talk to you.
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
Yours?
What?
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
Boo.
I know. Anyway --
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Let him go, Stan. I can help.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
How did I look?
Howard, your one o'clock.
Thanks.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
How do you mean?
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
Just wanted to let you know.
You can if you want.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
What's your bartlett's?
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
What do you believe in then?
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
You don't?
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
What is Debbie's position?
Extraordinary!
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
What do you think?
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
Are you in show business?
I was a successful model once.
A born freak can only go uphill.
Your ranch?
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
Justin?
Coop, where are you...
What?
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
How is he?
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
Do you hear it? Right there.
Pressure?
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
You wanted to see me, Admiral?
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
Yes...
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
Do we have enough time for a weld?
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Almost got it.
What the hell is that?
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
The forward airlock.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
You look like an eighties rock band.
I'll be watching over you.
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
He's made a few changes.
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
So are you!
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
But all these people...
Apparently I can disappear.
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
You're really cramping my style here.
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
How's the IPO?
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Which was?
What are you doing?
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
And reverse the mutations --
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
Why didn't you say something?
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Come on, Ben, come on...
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
Easy, mon.
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Why can't you do it?
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
I take out the garbage.
Is everything okay at work?
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Jeff you have company!
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
What's wrong?
Why don't you call me up tonight?
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
We've got to get an abortion?
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
Did you get her name?
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
So what makes you so sensitive?
How've you been?
My brother is gonna shit.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
What do you want?
Not coming? What happened?
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
What's that?
If you graduate.
It's very warm out tonight.
Are you really nineteen?
We keep them.
What's your other question?
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
Do you want to come inside?
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Two Cokes.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Let's have lunch!
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
Crying? Why was she crying?
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
GO?
I want to leave fast.
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
Yeah... I thought we might need it...
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
Yes!
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
The airport is over there!
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
Could I have that, please?
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?
What?
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
Well, it don't look pretty.
We'll be food, dickheads!
I'm in.
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
What do you mean what?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Is it gassed up?
Holds four.
Keys.
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
SHIT.
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
Am I too heavy for you?
What's wrong?
We all have to be strong, right?
Did we make it?
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
'Forgive'...? For What?
I guess so, sir.
Thank you --
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
No, I'm concerned with everything.
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Frances.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
Who?
Dick...
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
...Don't you?
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
Thanks, Dad.
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
You're poisoning that child's mind.
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
You can always come see it in London.
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Why?
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
Just one minute...
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
You think I'd miss it?
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
Quietly.
...So you think I should go.
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
What?
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... 
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
I took the early rounds.
I'll bet.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
No, Harry, I can't -- 
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
Anyway... if you need me...
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
...Is that not true?
Your big speech?
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
You kill me, Mama.
At one. Promise?
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
You're not going anywhere!
Oh, just leave those things for now.
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
I don't believe so.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
Please sit down...
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
This was not taken from a grave.
She's not for you.
Smell the air. Wonderful.
I wish to be your wife.
Professor?
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
Philosophical?
Professor Waldman.
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
Your men are right to be afraid.
Do you share my madness?
We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
Next Friday.
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
Oh, my God...
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
How come?
What is it?
I don't believe you...
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
Ned!
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
Mmmmmmmph.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
What's your name?
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Yes.
In heaven.
Died instantly?
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
What are you going to do?
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
To your family.
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
There's nothing wrong with this place.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
I'm going for 'em!
What did I say?
We have to go back for Daddy!
How many bullets left, kid?
-- you got your sink --
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
He says you were scratching.
Start the car.
Yeah?
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
We are?
That's what you think?
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
Who's "we"?
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
I'm fine, sir.
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
Oh, really.
No, sir.
See me, sir?
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Entering my scan now...
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
No, ma'am.
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
I'll try anyway, sir.
Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
Jordan...
I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
They're more afraid of you.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
O'Neil?
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
She part of the training?
32 feet, six inches!
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
I just wonder how that happened.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
How do you know?
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
Your old sweetheart?
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
Well, I think you're cute.
It's Tatopoulos.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
Sounds like a big company.
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
How do I do that?
This is it?
Is that the bathroom?
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
Go ahead!
~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?
He's a twit!
Shut up.
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
Hi Brandon.
Yes but, we were wondering-
What's  your name, son?
Yes...?
What do you mean?
No, wait, are you-
What's the weather like outside?
...The digital conveyor.
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
Oh, they're so cute.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
Yeah, what is it?
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
They're gone.
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
You know, that's really getting annoying.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
Wait. What did you say?
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
We pretend...
Weapons storage...
Former Commander?
Commander...
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
Excuse me?
What kind of signal?
Okay... On what?
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
I hope I never have to believe that.
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
Well, George, who were you?
While they're strung out?
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
Have you heard?  The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.
Me?  You apologizing to me?
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
I'm so inclined.
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
What are we going to do?
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
They are... friends of Congress.
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
Makes you gag.
No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
We already have black soldiers in our army...
Any word from Canada?
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
They help me understand why we fight.
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
Surely you knew this was coming.
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
I think I heard that.
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
You get the money?
Calm down, Bear...
And that's for the airport.
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
She's great. Gimme the money.
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
What three hundred grand?
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
You say look at you?
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
Leo spanked a waitress?
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
You make movies, huh?
Keep going.
So he comes to L.A...
That's it? That's your movie?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
"Mr. Lovejoy".
She looks familiar.
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
Hey, Harry.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
He died.
Yeah, he told me.
It was in the Herald.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
Compass.
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -– which by the way was a better book than a movie -– did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
Are you going down?
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
He already knew it.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
Pick 'n' Save.
Hello, Doris.
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
How did you get in the house?
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
You think the extra strain caused it?
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
What's so great about Sweden?
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
One more?
Roger?
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
Light in those passages ain't so good.
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
Three, four days.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
On a passenger ship in 1953?
So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?
You're late.
No.
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
So what did happen?
You're more practical than superstitious.
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
What guy?
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
The same day she supposedly went down.
Hey.
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
What's that supposed to mean?
Murphy to Epps.
Epps, over.
What do you think?
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
Over the gold.
We hit land.
Greer to Murphy.
Yeah.
Greer?
Ho-ly shit.
Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
How're you feeling?
You don't remember?
It's a Noaa buoy.
What's this?
Fifteen, at the most.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Not the Maxine?
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
Are you still looking for a job?
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
I didn't check my messages...
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
Are you the one who left that note?
Uh oh... don't turn around...
What? Why?
Since when is she an "actress"?
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
I remember every minute of that party.
What does it stand for?
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
JOSH!
Where did you get that?
Like what?
Which one?
He gives me a total boner!
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
God, you're really obsessed...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
Do you still want to do something tonight?
So should I come over?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
What are you talking about? Who?
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
When was this?
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
I dunno...
Well, we won't keep you.
Do you have any other old records besides these?
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
Norman.
I did too!
What?
Five hundred.
Do you have any old Indian records?
A dollar seventy-five.
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
Really? Can I see it?
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
Wow, this is so cool...
For nineteen years...
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
Oh yeah?
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Really?
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
...I better not...
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
Just someone so young...
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
No, of course not.
...What do you mean?
Yeah, sure. Of course.
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
What do you want?
I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
I am.
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
Thank you, doctor.
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
And it worked?
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
That's very considerate.
I can try.
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
What happened to them?
Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?
Thank you, Samuel.
Why so many?
Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now.  You two will sleep beautifully in your tents.  And stay there.
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
We don't have a relationship.
What are you working on, Egon?
Do you ever see him?
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
Does she know anything about babies?
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
Is this the spot?
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
Can I help you?
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
Who are you going to call?
Should we go?
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
Command me, lord.
Can I have some of your water?
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
I'd like to have a stool specimen
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
Oh, hiya, Pete.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Who, Ray?
What's that?
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
Now that's one ugly dude.
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
Is it a star?
Oh, Dana, it's you ...
Hi, Louis.
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
Do you want this body?
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
I want you inside me.
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
What's that got to do with it?
Is that a game?
Oh, that's very - unusual.
Die in what sense?
I don't believe in luck.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
Because you didn't say the magic word.
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Two wavy lines?
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Were you recently in the bathroom?
Did you see anything?
Something was definitely here.
Don't cross the beams.
What do you mean "bad?"
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
Looked at with your eyes.
Who was the architect?
Do you believe in God?
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
That's what you told me two days ago!
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
That's difficult to say, general.
You flatter me, Caesar.
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
Where is my family?
Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
I don't know...
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
Why do you play at being drunk?
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something.  If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something!  These men here are butchered for laughs!  Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line!
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
You brought the army into Rome.
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
Before they leave, get gold.
Wait a minute.
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
And it's all over now.
You sure you really want to?
That woman --
I want to ask you a question.
What did she say?
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
I don't see how we can.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
Why wouldn't it?
Thank you.
Ben.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
Will you bring it in to me?
A single. Just for myself, please.
What for?
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
When is he coming back?
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
Like what?
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
All right. Now finish your drink.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
I know that. But I'm --
What if he did?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
Why is it?
Yes, I do.
Hello, Benjamin.
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Yes?
What?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Who said it was my first time?
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
If you want.
Well what do you want to talk about?
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Do you want to hear it or not?
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
Not exactly.
I don't.
Is it?
What?
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
What was your major?
I wish you'd tell me.
There's nothing to tell.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Then let's hear them.
Yes.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
Don't start acting hurt.
What are you doing?
This is absurd.
Go home now.
What have you done to her?
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
Very good, sir.
What?
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
No.
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
You got me.
No. She doesn't know about it.
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
What?
You'll never be young again.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Mr. Robinson?
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
No, I don't.
Why?
It's Benjamin.
Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
You might find a bullet through that head...
You?
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Of course.
We'll dance.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
Why do you look at me like that?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
Yes -- I do understand.
Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
I know.
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
I can't.
Don't.
Thank you, sir.
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
How's the beautiful lady?
I thought she was splendid!
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
For me?
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
Any letters?
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Dance then? 
Really?
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Moreover...
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
What?
You're a little too fast.
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance. 
Of course -- of course. 
Insolent young cub!
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
Yes --
What?
Oh, come, Madam -- please come. 
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Hurry, Suzette.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
Certainly, sir.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
What do you want with her?
Pretty as a picture.
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
I want to keep my teeth.
Bobo, no, I --
You wanna talk to me straight up?
Motherhood.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Yes, yes, but that's --
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Sounds like a good Idea.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
Oh, come on, Roy.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
You must have some money.
Just a few bucks.
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Never.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
Scram. Go home.
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
Roy?
All? It ain't bad.
I want to know everything about you.
I'll sign that affidavit.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
The long end. Big con.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
I thought these people were broke.
He retired.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I saw her.
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
I don't think I need it.
No! Because I --
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
Roy Dillon?
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
Mr. Simms.
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
Carter.
My god...
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Nothing.
You stole it?
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
You okay?  You seem a little off.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
Hey, you alright?
What?
What's this?
Where's Shane?
Is Tim there?
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
What is it this time?
Halloween.
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Samhain.
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
What do you know about Michael?
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
I dunno, boy.
Um.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
Go home!
I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
Huh.
How do you know that?
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
In what way, pray tell?
Blue soup.
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
Gee whiz--
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
Do you know who Wanda June is?
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
"The sting."
Tell me that.
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
You're supposed to get hurt!
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Penelope!
Will you go to bed?
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
How do you do?
He's a very decent man, Harold.
I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
I have a brain.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
People don't use that word any more.
What then?
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
It seems highly intelligent to me.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
If he thinks he's man enough.
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
How do I load?
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
Hello, Mother.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
And her fiancé!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
None.
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
I've never heard of it.
Are you've seen it work cures?
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
Cut me open.  Find out.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
I'm going to shoot you now.
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
You didn't even find that out?
There was so much going on.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Premature ejaculation.
Ja?
She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
Kid--kid--
Thank God!
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
How did she lose her feet?
Where will you be?
No.
Don't know.
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
He is my father.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
What then?
Is he coming home?
Did you talk to Paul?
He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
Meaning?
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
Not true.
Or get eaten alive.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
Yes, we do.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
No.
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
But is she, has...
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
Wait?
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
Sam?
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
No.
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
You're not a film producer, are you?
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Half now, half later.
A friend.
Yeah.  I'm her father.
She's dead.
You don't understand shit.
He deals in pain.
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
More or less.
But what?
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
Andy.
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
Who's paying you?
What are you paying me for?
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
Does she know anything about this?
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
What is it, Jake?
What plan?
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
But I...
In other words, you want to get laid?
Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
Jake.
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
I don't know.
Eh, Poli Sci?
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Where are the papers?
Because if you are...
And what do you do, my dear?
Not very.
Sorry I'm late.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Nice to meet you.
Eh, no.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
No.
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Me! No. Of course not.
No. 
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
What is it?
But what?
But this is public property.
Thank you.
No more revolts.
What was that?
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
It's so blue.
No. I'd feel stupid.
Maude, I must speak to you.
What is it, Harold?
But they have.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
... which I hope will make you very happy.
But why now?
Mother.
No. My uncle.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
And a lot of time.
No.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
No.  I'd have liked to.
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
I want to go back!
And you're sure it was a woman?
I've got to finish it.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
I... remember.
He talked about Demons, huh?
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
It's almost over!!
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
I don't want him.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
-- should go back. Now!
No. Don't --
Thank you.
Yes?
What took you so long?
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
But it's not true, is it?
-- Late. Five minutes late.
What's the problem?
Let me alone, will you?
We want the man who did this --
It's important.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
Julia!
One last time. Give me the box.
You're Julia, right?
Oh.
What about Larry --
I'm very happy.
Not know.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
You can't love him.
Don't you care?
Kirsty.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
All right.
Why not?
So damn stupid.
Julia?
Sure.
I'll be down in a minute
Is this upsetting you?
Huh?
Just soda.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
What's going on?
Kirsty?
I got through.
What did you say?
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
Yeah.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
Finished?
He's gone.
Get the fuck out of here.
You're not going?
She's so damn... English.
I've been better.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Can I lend you a hand?
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
Steve. Thank God you came.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
What's next?
I wanna date a musician...
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
What the fuck is that?
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Fine.  That's great.
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Hey Rob.
'Morning, Dick.
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
Rob.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
So shall we leave it at that then?
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
So you weren't interested in music at all?
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
Nevermind.
Never?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
We'll talk some other time.
Is that the last of it?
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
Those aren't mine.
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
You're soaking.
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
C'mon.  I want to know.
What's the difference?
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
No.  Probably not.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
Rob here.
What's the -- hey, Liz --
It's a crematorium.
Is Ray going?
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Enough, Liz.
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
Hi, Mom.
Great.  Super-fantastic.
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
But you must have --
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
Naw.  Those are for us.
Records are those big round black things, right?
It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
Huh?
Happy birthday.
This is against the rules.
Why not?
Tradition.
Who is he?
Is this what you killed them with?
You make it all sound so simple.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
Who are you?
He is older than I.
There are differences.
Come here, Brenna.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
It'll never stick.
What's all of this got to do with me?
Who is it?
You're not from these parts.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Yes.  Always.
Go to hell.
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.
Of course.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
Some think not.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
Something pretty.
State of grace and all that.
No doubt.
Complete your inspection?
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
He knows I'm here.  How?
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
I knew his great-grandfather.
Of sorts.
Run!
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
We have some unfinished business.
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
That's none of your business.
A mystery.
What's the idea of locking this?
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
How do you mean?
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
Oh, it isn't like that.
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.
Yes, wasn't it?
Did you finish the interview?
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
You're Bruce Baldwin?
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Oh.
Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.
Anything the matter?
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
Get out!
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
What's this?
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
Exclusive? That's great.
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
Huh!
How much do you want on it?
All the words you've got.
Where's Bruce?
What tickets?
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Is this the Community Hospital?
Ring that number, will you?
When did you deliver this first?
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!
Sure.
Walter!
Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
Who do you want?
I'm busy, Duffy.
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
Me, too.
I don't know --
Who locked the door?
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Pete, I want to talk to you!
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
What is it?
No -- don't out me off.
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
Phone for you, Hildy.
Who is it?
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
First you got to sign a receipt. 
Where's the money?
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
That's good.
That man there!
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
What good'll it do?
Are you all right, now?
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
That was a googly!
Why?
But Grandpa, you said...
Sod.
You wouldn't.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
Can't we just see the end?
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
I don't know?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
And Jim.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
You joined up.
It looks....foreign.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
He always knows.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
You might still have a house.
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Ma, Tiny's in.
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
How long have you been running this place?
I don't drive cross country.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
Yeah, no shit.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
Oh yeah, I remember now.
Really fucking awesome.
She looks like she stinks.
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Thanks.
Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
I like sleep.
What's he so excited about?
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
Drive through it!
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
Fascinating.
Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
Yeah?
When?
I don't know, I think he's funny.
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
Geez, he never gets tired does he.
You got to be fucking joking.
How long has it been?
Jesus Christ.
Not yet.
Open up the trunk.
No, just a little too old.
What should I do?
Fit the profile?
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
I always favored the Hulk.
Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
Wydell.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
Gabrielle.
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
Oui.
What is wrong, my darling?
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
Anyway. Come already to the point.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
Hunh.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
So?
Yeah?
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
As do I.
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
It looks wonderful.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
I'll be out in a minute.
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Shaving cream?
Flares?
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
Really?
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
So he's doing okay?
Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
Ugnh.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
To win.
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
Will you take a check, Bert?
How much do I owe you?
Cut.
I got drunk.
A thousand.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
Eddie, you're a born loser.
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
Where do I sign?
What happened to you anyway?
Thinking about what?
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
Sure.
Tell her what?
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
The expensive kind.
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
Why?
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Get with what?
Go to hell.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
Just like that?
Findley.
When?
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
You quittin', friend?
I used to be an actress.
You don't look like a college girl.
Well, he owns things.
Well, what else does?
What do you want to tell me?
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
Hundred dollars?
You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
I came to play pool, Fats.
What do you mean?
Yes.
Emma...
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
Yes.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
Hell of a night.
We're going to be moving, son.
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
If we want it, it is.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Are you all right, Dad?
It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
I'm home now.
What's wrong, Ellen?
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
Yes.
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
Yes.  I can even read star maps.
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
Who are you calling?
Don't go in.
You have to leave the White House.
With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
Can you believe this?
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
It's perfect the line is busy?
You punched the President in the face?
Dad, please...
Get us out of here!
Is my wife in the air?
Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's doing what?
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
Be careful.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Oh. Sorry.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
It's all fuzzy.
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
How' he doing?
Yes.
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
Your treat.
Dad?
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
Ah, Venice...
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
Alexandretta. Now we know.
Look what you did!
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
Doctor Jones?
Yes?
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
Are you sure?
Don't wander off.
At least I let you tag along.
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
Oh, it breaks the heart.
Through the library?
...you did it.
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
How did you she was a Nazi?
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
The floor's on fire! See?!
Head for the fireplace!
Dad!
Stop!
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
What about Marcus?
What did you get?
We didn't talk. We never talked.
You left just when you were becoming interesting.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
Dad, are we hit?!
Nice landing.
Those people are trying to kill us!
I don't need camels.
Who are you?
Interested in local curios?
We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
What's that?
Indy?
Indy, look!
What you look at, Indy?
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
That's far enough!
Hey, he's not a waiter...
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
What'd he say?
THE WHAT?!
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
What?!
WILLIE?!
A fulcrum release lever!
I want to go home...
What're we going to do?!
Anymore ideas...?
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
Where are you,...Al?
Try me.
Don't do that.
Me.
Your name is Al...
Yes.
What street?
Are you threatening me?
No.
I know...it sounds insane.
What for?
Yep.
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
Now what?
Too late...They want you.
Why? AL  You know too much.
I am. You are.
Which way do I go?
Take a left and your next right.
A lab and equipment.
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
You need ID in there?
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
Now what?
Eat it.
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
What's happening?
Which language?
Help me out, will you?
.
You're not just after this girl, are you?
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
I feel like an idiot.
How do you know?
Voice stress analyzer.
What Happened?
Bingo.
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
And Dieter?
Aim just in front of his face.
This may hurt.
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
Not that truth!
No!
I'm...scared.
What happened?
In him?
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
Sir?
He's not an ordinary man.
You may not remember things.
What things?
How do I look?
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
I feel fine.
I will?
What?
Just give me the keys.
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
Blake?
I can't do that?
Do what?
Can I help?
Why do you do it?
You did.
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
Is that Ryuji?
Joe! What happened to you?
Why did you stay with me?
They kidded me a little.
What did you tell them?
No.
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
You don't believe me.
And you?
How?
Why'd you ask him.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
I can't fly it.
Looks like they can. What did they do?
What did you tell them?
Kiss her you fool.
Now what?
He told me what to do.
Why not?
Ow?...
Look, nobody knows we did it.
So we better get started.
Hi, honey.
I'll take some.
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Where?
Three hours.
P.J.'s.
Push it.
What was that about?
Good.
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
I'm afraid you are.
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
Uh, what are those boxes?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Right now?
What's the difference...
Can we talk about this when I get back?
"60 Minutes," the television show?
Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
What?!
Get some perspective, Lowell.
Alright?
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
Hardly new news.
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Did work.
How much would I get paid?
Seven dwarfs?
Hello. You there
What did you get us?
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
You charge by the hour?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
You attract a crowd.
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
That's not the point.
You try and have a good time.
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
You're gonna get your fix...
Poor communication skills.
"I would bet on it."
"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
You threatening my family, now, too?
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
So she's uh, flourishing?
What a touching story.
Excuse me?
Objection, your honor!
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
Is she Asian?
Asian? No.
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
My God.
Marylin! What have I done?
So who'd you hire?
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
How do you know?
What is it you're after, Miles?
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
She never particularly cared for me.
She didn't love you?
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
What is it Miles?
You do?
Good.  Are those foods?
Hi.
You don't like me?
I don't believe you have "things."
You can't prove anything.
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
I fell in love Miles.
Hello Marylin.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
Rex. Get away from the door.
Do you need a Tagamet?
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
Is this Ming?
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
Yes?
That's delusional.
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Wrigley!
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Let me tell you something about Patty.
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Yeah.
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami—  for the love of it?
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
You're a peculiar chap.
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to—
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
I knocked several times.
Oh, yes. I heard.
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
Why; naturally, I—
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Yeah?
I beg your pardon!
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
That's right. You didn't.
Beat it! 
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
Outside!
Like this. I have no robe.
Where'd you say the showers—and things—were? 
Hurry up and get dressed.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Um. You're doing all right.
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
You always want to run everything.
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
I'm following you.
Yes.
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
What's the matter?
What's got into you?
know—but—
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
Raw?
Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?
Nope.
Me?
ONE—TWO—THREE—FOUR—FIVE
Not interested. 
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
Eight o'clock tonight.
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
What time is it?
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that—
Get out of here!
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars—and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
Well, I'll be—
When you sober up—come in and see me.
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Yeah. Come on—come on!
That's right.
Five G's—or I crab the works.
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see—and—
Sure—sure—I'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
No.
What was his voice like?
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
And Oswald?
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
You still questioning any Cubans?
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
That's our case!
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
I don't believe it!
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
Nonsense.  What next?
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
And if you're wrong?
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
They killed him, honey.
For sexual purposes?
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
Can we find her?
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
How many men?
The Warren Commission call him?
Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
I just plain don't trust him anymore.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
Do you walk home?
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
Look, man, I know I owe you --
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
She wants to go back to work.
What's in it?
How was your flight?
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
The Delfonics.
'74, I think.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
How was it?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
You talk them into it?
They seem to like the idea.
I called you last night.
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
Did you do it that night?
I'm not sure you answered my question.
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
How'd you find out?
Ray wants him.
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
I'm just tired in general.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, Miss Brown?
Look, that shit ain't mine.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
No.
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
She didn't say.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
That would be one point of view.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
Buy ya a beer?
Killian's.
How long you been with Ordell?
You think I'm kidding?
Dreaming.
I got some vodka in the freezer.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
Beaumont Livingston.
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
How the fuck they know that?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
A woman.
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
What the hell you talkin' bout?
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
When did you get out of jail?
Susanville.
Were you a disco girl?
Were you a disco guy?
No.
Please.
You live with him.
Yeah, down the end.
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Whatcha watchin'?
I'm in my underwear.
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
It's Louis.
So what, you left her there.
Couldn't talk to her?
Pretty sure.
Then what?
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
How am I supposed to know that?
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
House or apartment?
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
Hear what?
Did the police contact you?
Beaumont worked for you.
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Where is it?
You know who this is?
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
Call her, tell her the combination.
You expect me to just walk in there?
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
It's the next street.
My money's in that office, right?
No.
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
Take me home.
I'm alive.
Remember?
Dream on!
I see.
Just to see you. That's all.
Daddy. Let go.
Short? It's ended.
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
It's hard to explain.
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
Doctor.  Ph.D.
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?
Why do you say that?
How long had that been going on?
Not me, buddy.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
What? By myself?
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
No.  I see them.
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
Jacob, what can I do?
What happened to you?
Thanks.  What's that?
Who? Jed?
She looked good then.
Not to me.
Wait. Don't.
Jake!
I'm going home.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
Don't be funny.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
I don't know.
One drop?
Where's Wong?
He's burning up.
Total delirium.
He's burning up.
I'm sorry.
I need to see you, Jake.
I just need to talk.
I don't know what to do.
I've seen them too ... the demons!
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
No one knows. They say it blew up.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
The hull's imploding!
Earth II.
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
We need weapons.
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Where are you going?
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
Rizzo, pull away!
You okay?!
And what's with the headgear?
Now that's just gross.
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
Later.
I don't know...sorry?
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
I don't understand...what does he want?
What?
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You wanna die?
What have you done?
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
My cars. And a comic book.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
What do you mean 'We...?'
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
Who's driving the boat?
You got it?
Shut up! Just pump her out!
He's trying to sink us!
He's comin' up -- !
How come you have to tell them that?
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
Home... New York?
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
I don't know if I can do that without a...
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
Where'd you get all this?
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
This has got to be one big violation...
What the hell?
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
Think she might've run out on you?
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
Is that a boat?
This is Quint, Missus.
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
Yup.
I don't really know anything about it.
No... I guess not.
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
No.
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
Blood and guts.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
Like what?
Junk?
You know... it's parts...
What is it?
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
Cute?
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
You should try Adderall.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
Who is the kid?
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
Excuse me?
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Or...
Is this Juno?
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
The Penny Saver sucks.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
You don't say.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
You lose!
...I said, I like your hair.
What?
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
Happy birthday Adele.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
What's wrong with her?
What's your name, boy?
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
Dahlia, no.
Now why is that?
Yeah.
If you say so.
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
Why?
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
Who said he's my good buddy?
Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
Not yet.
Nervous?
Where's Adele?
Early, just think...
His Parole Officer.
You're clean.
What do you think?
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
What?
Yeah.
What for? That guys a dick.
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
He lives on 76th?
The cartoon?
Right.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
I don't understand why you do that.
Where you goin' tonight?
You goin'?
Yeah.
Na.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
You were?
She won't? Why not?
Uh huh.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
What do I want to do?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Miss, would I be prying?
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
Mine?
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Wish me luck.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
You've heard the stories right?
Holy shit. That's all true?
No. I was just kidding.
Yeah.
I can't man.
We seem to have a little problem here?
What kind of problem?
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
What?
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
Then what's he talking about?
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
No shit!
Why did you write remember on the wall?
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
You'll find her.
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
Let me speak to my daughter.
You don't understand.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
What is it?
What scars?
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
You must be Erica.
Uh huh.
What are you doing up?
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
Yeah.
How long she been dead?
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
I'm busy right now.
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
As large as castles.
We're going to work on the message.
The most logical choice.
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?
What have you come up with on the riddle?
We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
Are we going to go through this again?
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.
It's a good play, but risky.
We got a problem?
Peter...
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
In a way.
This isn't a game.
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
Do you?
No.  You were talking about chess.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
You.
Did you call?
What's wrong?
It's not that easy.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
But I do.
You're going to be late for your match.
I'm sure you are.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
About what?
Have they harmed you?
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
Will your power outward.
Does the Queen live?
I have no extraordinary powers.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
There is nothing.
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
Can she be forced?
From here, I must go alone.
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
No! You cannot know that!
Slayers!
Yes.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
Once is enough, thank you.
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
You will follow me.
When did you last sleep, boy?
I'm not hungry.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
They'll trample him to death!
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
Knowledge I wouldn't want.
The Widow of the Web?
She has the power to kill.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Her name is Death.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
She was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
You see?
Of what?
Yeah... How do you know it?
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
What, for example?
Good! First shot!
What?
Mathilda? May I come in?
Why?
When I say I love you.
What shall we do?
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
...Yes.
You say it just to calm me!
Huh?
You can't sit here like that.
Salute.
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
I don't accept that.
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
I have to finish first.
Yes?
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
I've changed my mind.
Maurice?
Go to sleep Ellen.
His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
Red flag, man.
Not our problem.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
Making the grand total?
What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
I'm walking there Kris.
I missed you Kris.
Steph.
Is it a boy or a girl?
What do you mean?
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
You're pretty drunk.
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
How long have I been here?
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
Yes... I'll give you that.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
You know I love you... yeah?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
Yuri... are you...
But it's a top three school --
Why would I kill my husband?
Go to hell.
What?
It's so shameful...
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Did you get it?
So everything you just said --
Was she carrying a weapon?
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
Is she?
God, that felt great!
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
What?
Picking out my wedding dress!
What?!
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
Why?
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Are you asking me on a date?
Is he the only one?
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
Of course.
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
You go where?
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
Let's all go! Road trip!
Your love.
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
I am afraid of nothing.
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
I don't expect you'd understand.
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
Or looked so beautiful...
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
You come stealee tleasoo?
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
What do I do?
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
There aren't enough arrows.
One more turn...
The wound is mortal.
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
Never.
I detest serpents.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
My father and the Baron.
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
Tis not fit for a princess.
You've freed me, Jack...
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
Pinching?  Where?
I can't see a thing.
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
Ask away, sweet man.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
And am I not fair?
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
What's she doing?
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
What's that for?
Why?
Can you keep Sam straight?
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
Did you feel anything?
You look better without make-up.
I'll get your back.
Yeah.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
What are you talking about?
Not really.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
And of course the Beck's, with the...
An exhaust system or a window is code.
I hate to ask about a window.
What are you on?
how much weight have you lost?
For everything.
Thank you.
You're here early today.
Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
I warned you yesterday.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
What would you like to be?
I know parts of who you are.
When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
I wish you had told me then.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
Are you taking them still?
What kind of house?
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
Oh.  Sorry.
It's okay.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
I drove over and you were gone.
I did say he could go.
Which?
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
Where's Sam?
I'll find something that won't kill them.
What did I say?
It sounded like a pick-up line.
I'm married.
What did he say?
Don't move!
What are you doing home?
I guess I could teach you some things.
There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
The door was open.
This is what he wants.
Why?
What did you say?
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
Go tell your father we're eating.
Dad's home, already?
No, nigger.
And the baby?
He's a big one.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Yeah...
Take care of me?
Want me to come back some other time?
Yes, boss.
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
That's because I've never been here before.
Can't you remember your own name?
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
What gave you that idea?
So you made a generous contribution.
He's dead.
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
You know what I'm saying.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
What does that mean?
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
What'd you say?
We'll just get off at the next stop.
I don't know. Who do you want?
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
You get ketchup?
What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
Let it go, Claude.
My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going.
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
I can't do it.
What'd you say?
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
'Course I was right. About what?
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
You didn't get ketchup?
If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.
I'm all right.
You ever done time before?
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
Hey, the dude's holdin'.
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
What do you think about that?
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
They gave me life, mama.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
He's sick?
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
We could create our own hell there.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
No!
And give you a good buzz.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
My mom wasn't a goat?
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
By she, do you mean he?
Yes, great movie...
Adrian?
You think I'm a tourist?
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
What are you doing?
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
..."The Devil?"...
Nicky!
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
Off limits.
Hey...
See something you like, my man?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
All right -- what are you?
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
Where do you send them?
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
Your own work?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
You missed something special.
Anybody we know?
Where do you live, Mary?
Here.
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
Not about that.
Six. I go red next year.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
About running, dying what?
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
Where did you get that?
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
I'm afraid.
I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
Beloved husband...
What does that water do?
We'll have to bury him.
Are there any other humans?
Gracious... no.
But there may be a few around somewhere.
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
I don't think so.
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
You okay, man?
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
I was here yesterday.
Hi.
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
He'll kill us.
He works for Mr. Eddy.
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
Sheila?
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
The wife killer?
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
You talk to him?
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
Where is he now?
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
No, sir, it's not.
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
What's the matter?
My... My head.
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
At your house.
Where's Alice?
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
Does it say anything on the tape?
When you didn't come to the club.
Called? When?
From the club. You didn't answer.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
What's that? Another tape?
Where would you feel safe?
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
Hello.
Okay.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
It was weird...
Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
What about those men we met this morning?
I'm a paleontologist.
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
Okay, brother.
Don't call me brother.
Good morning, Lovey.
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
It certainly is.
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south—
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
Certainly not.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
What are we going to do?
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
Huh?
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
I say, will you have a cigarette?
Hey - look!
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
You mean you don't want to go?
So there are others?
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including—  —the excess of virtue itself.
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
Well, is it?
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
The only one.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
Oh, I'm so glad.
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
You're lying, aren't you?
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
Hurray!
George, what are you going to do?
Well - I mean—
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
You can't leave, George.
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
I don't need any proof.
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
That was easy. I read your books.
Ouch!
You see, it's not a dream.
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
How about you? Do you want to go?
Go? Where?
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
EXCUSE ME–
All right, I'll be there.
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
What the hell...
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
Only the damn guy won't know it.
I'd go with number three.
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
We'll take it from here.
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
It's a bug.
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
You don't know the half of it.
Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.
You don't know me at all.
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
You think that's what's-happening?
Kay--
How does that help me?
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
What are you doing?
Yeah ... ?
You figured what?
Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
Noon exactly.
Did he say where?
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
They're gone.
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Did it leave?
Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
What?
Why?
What --
-- but he didn't.
Found?  Where?
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
It's all I could safely move.
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
You the only sentry?
Hence the expression...
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
Somebody named Leo Crow.
You can't run --
Everybody runs.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
You set me up...
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
She spoke to me.
I need your help.
They don't belong to anybody.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
I won!
It's a little late for that.
I forgive you.
I wanted to.
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Kill me!
You're not gonna kill me...
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
What's so funny?
You don't seem all that proud.
You're talking about the precogs...
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
If... you have one.
Who?
We know why John was tagged.
Congratulations, sir.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
I don't understand --
Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
There's thousands of units like this one.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
How many?
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
What about your meeting?
That was our apartment.
Since right after we lost our son.
It was nobody's fault.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
You know I need to use you.
Wally, the other two can still function, right?
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
So?
As far as...?
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
Will you leave me alone, already...? No, Sean, it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact, I am... Yeah. In his hotel room...
He's okay.
No.
Oh, please.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
Ho's a good guy --
Shhh. He'll hear you.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
What'd you say?
Draw.
5-5-1.
He making the drop?
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
Where is this happening?
Sure. Yeah.
Why?
This one?
Then what are you saying?
I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
Where is the Soho Grand?
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Yeah.
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
It's important.
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
Fuck them.
Fuck him.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
Who you calling?
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
Forty-six.
What are you doing?
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
About what?
You too?
He wants to see us now.
We're getting whacked.
Let's do it.
The penguin house.
We need guns.
I'm pretty sure we do.
All the more reason.
Wanna bet?
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
No more, man.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Bobby and Ricky.
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
A little.
Yes?
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
See you later.
No?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
What about my keys?
So, wait, what are we dropping off?
And where might that be?
What they call you?
Keeps me out of the army.
Where can I get a hold of you?
Yes, sir.
Solid, daddy.
I told you less paper, less trouble.
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
What the hell for, man?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
What?
There's nothing to talk about.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
Are you?
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
Let some of us come down there.
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
Let's cancel.
What color were the original Hebrews?
Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
You know that gal?
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
Get out.
Did you hear me?!
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
The hell you are.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
Who the hell are they?
He told you that?
I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
I don't know shit about you.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
Where do I find you?
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
Where does he live?
[How does it work?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[What do you mean?]
[Do you know who I am? I am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.]
[Don't lie to me!]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
What are you doing here?
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
I'm a bargain.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
It's better to be free, right?
They'll be back in a week.
Did you used to?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
That's not a question.
Dyslexic?
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Jordan!
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
You helped him get this job.
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
Oh, yeah.
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
Who?
When was this?
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
You come up here often?
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
Wadda you think?
Yes, I know.
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
I'm stag.
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
What, Ma?
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
What nurses?
Waddaya mean, Ralph?
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
Tommy!
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
Don't you use olives?
Miss you, Walt.
You really think we hurt him that bad?
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
Y'all just act natural.
That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
I was just asking...
Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
What for?
We stand behind all our work.
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
Is he out?
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want.
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
See you.
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
Ayuh.
Even if I weren't.
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
Just in dreams?
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
In the direction you want to go.
You can cut the bow.
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
Morning, girls. Good morning Major.
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied—
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
How much money do you get?
Hello?
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
We'll get a handwriting expert to—  What!
Say that again.
Well, you're catching on.
That's our man. He's made to order.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
I ain't seen him for a week.
Had any schooling?
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there—
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy—
Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
A what?
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
Now, that's all right, isn't it?
Listen, pal—this fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
What difference does that make?
No, I didn't write it, but—
Oh!
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Nineteen!
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
Floor seats.
You're my hero.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
Tell my dad.
Am I gettin' the car?
You think you can learn, McCall?
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
We won!
How much you wanna bet?
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
Please. I'm begging you.
That a new picture?
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
You think I didn't need you?
You got a bet on the game tonight?
It's already started.
Stay up there, Girl...
Roper.
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
What do we got?
What have you promised them?
This is Halden.
Okay...
Why?
How come I can't remember?
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
You were right.
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
You were the one who was dying.
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
Won't be time if he gets access --
Try harder.
What?
Where?
You said we were on the same programming team.
Realize?
And it meant something.
What?
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
We've got him locked!
He's on us!!
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one.  Now, put your hands inside the flame.
1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
Where did it originate?
I see... a fox
Let's go after him!!
The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
And how do we release the power?
But boss, what about their parents?
"Basically".
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
THREE SECONDS!!
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
You own a hotel, sir?
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
Charlie Luciano.
What do you mean?
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
Have you thought about this?
You could have stopped him.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
What are ya thinkin'?
Don Maranzano. Welcome.
And the Jews?
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
I don't fuck my partners.
We must be friends, Charlie.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
And what do you want out of this?
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Who did this?
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
<u>Why</u>??
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
Can't you give it to me later?
Look at this! He won't let us leave!
Who?
I might wake up.
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
Hypnos?
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
Where'd he go??
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
I'm good.
But I was dusting.
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
Mom, I need to talk to you.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
Mother!
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
I see.  How much?
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
It was?
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
Would you settle for a husband?
Oh--that again. Yeah.
You know--little worms--ambition.
I'm still asking myself--what is he-- animal, vegetable, or mineral? A Senator! A United States Senator! I thought I'd seen everything but-- why, he doesn't know what time it is, Diz! When I think of myself sitting around--playing straight for all that phoney, patriotic chatter-- *me*, carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists--no, I can't take it, Diz--I'm through--I quit!
Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
You play--left field.
I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
"There's more light here," he says--
Yeah. Some of my best friends are funny.
Waiter!
I apologize.
I'll cherish ya.
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
What?
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
Huh?
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Can't that wait, Hubert?
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
How do you feel, champ?
He's batty!
Oh--oh.
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
Where were you?
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
Nonsense, Jeff.
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
Yield *how*, sir?
Mr. President! A point of order!
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
How's Amos, Ma?
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
What is it?
What's your name?
Convene?
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
No! Stop it!
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
Wait--
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
A camp! Well!
Then you *did* say it.
Well--I--
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
How's that, buddy?
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?
Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
Well--me, too!
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
What do you think?
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
You can't say *that* to--
It's crucifying him--!
Anything *better* to offer?
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
His first 'whiff'!
Senator Paine will state it!
Since he was born.
He sure is pixilated.
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
You are , aren't you?
What happened?
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
What did they say?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
It's wonderful.
There's Times Square.
I'm from a small town too, you know.
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
What's the matter, hon?
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That—"
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
Boy, was he burning.
John—
Stuff, sir?
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
We'll send for the police!
I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.
Yes?
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
You're going to New York with us.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Why should you?
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
Entertainment?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Why not?
—my wife wanted me to tell you she—  —she prays for you every night.
Huh?
No.
Your Honor—
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out.  Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
Farmer?
South Dakota - but on the top.
Prairie? Oysters?
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
Oh, I do too, sir.
You came home last night - without them.
I did what!
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
Please!
Hey, did you hear that?
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
Me more than most.
Really? You think so?
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
No, not really.
But you do therapy?
Ernest, what do you think?
...And I from Phyllis.
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
What is it?
It's a thought I had.
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
What brought this on?
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
Oh?
You do?
I think it's like... inquisitive.
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
And the Brocketts?
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
He told you.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
But you know how to drive?
Sure.
Don't need it.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
How are you?
We're going for a walk.
I think you know what I mean.
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
Sorry... I'm done.
I can give myself a headache instantly.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
It's all right.
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
Of course.
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
You feel violated?
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
That's not quite what I said --
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
What did he want you to do?
This is exactly what I wanted.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
Slash what?
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
And a birth certificate is enough?
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
And then killing your sister.
If he arrives before us, it will be too late.
Let's make us even, shall we?
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
Immune from what?
What does he want the book for?
Intestines.
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
What is he doing here?
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
You bastards!
Fifty percent.
No?
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
You know your history.
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
Not unless you call me Rick.
Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
Don't do it, Evelyn.
According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my.
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Finish the inscription, idiot!
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
It must have slipped my mind.
Where are you going?
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
When was that?
Atta, girl!
But you're a superhero.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
Hey... you okay?
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
Should I kill them?
That boy's got talent.
Against.
Are you an actress?
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
You drink too much.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
Have you ever seen him?
So what else has Superman got?
But she still might call!
Are you coming or not?
Why not?
Maybe she's right.
Sounds good.
Maybe there was traffic.
Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
The Obliterators!
Jeffrey!
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
I use it... to fight evil.
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
This looks like a job for Superman --
Where am I going?
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
What do you think Napoleon will do?
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
And who is defending Paris?
Yes, sire?
No, sire... I was asleep.
Was the trip normal in every respect?
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
Ajaccio.
How did it spread so quickly?
It is the work of incendiaries.
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
Does your mother know you have come?
Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
No -- not as a rule.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
Were any of them married?
Promise me you will never leave me.
What are you doing in there?
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
What are you talking about?
You couldn't face telling me what?
What was there to tell?
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
What I am talking about is moderation.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
Okay, I know what I want this time.
That's it?
It's cool, but where's the water?
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
Yes you did.
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
Nobody!
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
This you?
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
What's the matter?
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
Blow.
It works.
That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
You want us to give you a ride?
I don't know.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
Delivery!
Can I help you?
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
What it smell like?
You coming in?
Excuse me?
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
Ah damn.  Damn.
Tape his mouth shut.
Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
What about that ugly dog?
Elroy, what happen?
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
Amtrack?
I appreciate that.
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
This? I've never even fired one.
For what?
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
Daddy?
How should I...?
You know what I'm gonna do.
Are you sure?
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
We have to hurry.
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
You remember me?
Please...
What am I supposed to say to her?
Well?
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
You stole that.
Where are we going?
Why?
Get moving.
Only you.
What gives?
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
When'll the skiff be ready?
Yes! Yes!
And the Lord told that man --
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
Pearl dotes on him.
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
What!
I tried to save her.
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
John...
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
Where are we goin', John?
Up river.
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
I'll tell you a secret.
Now it's your turn.
How old are you?
Can I have this?
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
What do you figure to do?
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
Answer me!
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
Them kids is yours?
What?
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
Okay?
Jesus, it's dark in here.
You do?
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
Just want to talk to him a second.
What's the Coroner got to say?
She lived there.
How you know that?
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
And then what happened?
Jungle man fix Jane.
Good evening, Anna.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
You feel it, though.
What is it, Anna?
Or it might be the firing squad!
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
He's cutting our throat...
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
The Duchess...
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
I am, Gaston.
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
Get out of here!
What proposition?
Comrade.
Yes, monsieur?
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
What's that?
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
If there is anything we can do for you...
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Yes!
Oh no. No visa.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
What for... why?
You, please.
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
He takes good care of that.
Ni-notchka.
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
It's twelve o'clock.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
I don't like your following me.
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
Yes.
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
Not white, darling.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
No! No!
Would that make you any happier?
Who cried that one?
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
What does he say?
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
Yes, Swana, you did.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Yes.
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
Madame, if you...
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
Where are they?
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
Here, please...
What do you want?
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
I don't understand.
Raw carrots and beets.
Where do you eat?
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
So ... let's go ...
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
I understand that, sir.
You do it.
How so?
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
He wants money.
Why not?
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
There's no secrets here, Al.
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
That was civil war.
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
Money.  Follow the money.
... never complain, never explain, John ...
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.
Yes, Mother ...
Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning.
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
I can't ...
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
Not if I give you all the cards ...
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party.
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
I beg your pardon --
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
Why?
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
And Dick beat the shit out of them.
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
How many?
You all right?
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
It's over, Dick.
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
This.  Above all.
Then I'll be there for you.
Then what are you scared of, honey?
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
They're all your enemies?
You.  What' you're doing --
Don't be ridiculous!
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
What?
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
Want a cup?
'Predate it.
That man that shot you died in prison.
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
You don't know what he thinks.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
Most don't.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
Yes.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
No sir.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Yessir.
...This month's checks.
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
I can't plan your day.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
No.
Not like that. Not like you say.
What're you doin', baby?
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
Hey.
What should I do?
You know what's goin' on?
What makes you say that?
Why would I let you do that?
Where does he work?
I can't say.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
...I know where you are.
Yeah? Where am I?
Yeah. I know where you're going.
All right.
Is somethin' wrong?
You already asked me that.
See about closing.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
Tent poles.
Good. I need everything else.
November the 28th, last year.
Waitin' for my wife.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
Then you'll like me.
What did I say?
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
Bad idea...
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
Anyway, so what?
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
They're fine... you miss it?
...I... I know what you are.
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
...I don't think I know that hospital.
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
...well, then you ain't got much.
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
Dr. David Ravell.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
I'll go to the Hospital.
She called you 'George,' George.
What are you doing?
I got this apartment with a guy.
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
No, almost never.
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
Fine. You got five...
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Now, that's really stupid.
You told me how to do it!
Well, why'd you shoot him?
I wanted to make a statement.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
What the hell was that, another statement?
I hope you're right...
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
What?
Worse... you're in Texas.
No.
What doesn't?
I never said that I believed...
Wesley...
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Really?
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Better.
What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
What do we do now, Everett?
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
A miracle! It was a miracle!
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Vernon Waldrip.
Not out the other side his face, though.
I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
You said -
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
Well, I'm sorry honey -
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Who's the honcho around here?
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
It was a powerful air.
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Yes, Sir.
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
I want your D.O.R.
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
It's important, sir!
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
I know.
What did you call me, boy?
I called you Sarge.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
You're sure it's okay?
How late?
What other issue is there, Sid?
You what?
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
Lynette, where's Sid?
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
Yeah? Why're you here?
You stayed after all.
Want me to get a towel?
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
Does it still hurt?
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
So?
How do you figure that's your bunk?
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
Jets.
Look at Foley! Can you believe it!
No problem, but who's Susan?
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
Bullshit.
NOT THAT ONE?!
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Hey.
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
Yeah?
We'd like to come in.
Huh?
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
That's highly inappropriate.
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
We're leaving.
I don't think so, but I love her album.
The furniture guy?
What if they get in here?
Fuck.
Are you freaking out?
What am I, a five year old?
Uh uh.
Stop it.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...
Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
That's right brother... listen and learn.
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
So what's the deal?
What's the pig's name?
I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police.
I saw... but...
Just a kid.
If you got something to say, say it.
What's up with you?
You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
You alright?
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Late summer.
I know him well enough?
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
That one is a bit more difficult.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
Sir?
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Are you going to meet with him?
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
You're in no condition to ride.
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
Cheraw Falls.
Where?
An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
Thirteen years...
We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
And your principles?
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
Where is he now?
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
Yeah, sure.
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
God, that's fine.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Yes, but--
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
I guess so...but...
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
Yes.
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
Thank you, Louis.
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
No!  You gave your word!
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
No, I really think I do.
So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
I'll drop it!
Thank you, sir.
I can't breathe.
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
Then I can wear men's clothing.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
I knew it.
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
Exactly.
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
Dead serious.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
Where does it make berth?
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
'Bootstrap?'
That's not true.
Wait -- what about the pistol?
Jack!
No, it's not.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
He may be.
No, thank you.
I brought you up here, Dr. Bright, because I want you to understand that we are on the path.  The only difference is that you are walking with your head down, afraid to look up, to see where the path is going.
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
What are you going to do to him?
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
Like rotting meat.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
Icky!  What's happening?
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
If you loved me like I loved you?
Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
A man?
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
You were never invited to my house.
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
Is that what Argon told you?
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
Been out for six months now.
The big house?
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
Mouse?  What mouse?
Yes.
Susan!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Do you have something to bring me down?
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
Oh no.  They're trying to blame you for the accident.  That means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
I have to!
This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  Now I won't have to come looking for you.
Yeah, and what might that be?
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
What in the hell?
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot—
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
No? What do you look upon her as?
—and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
I knew your managing editor very well.
Huh?
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
Oh, is that so?
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
Come on, get going, get going!
I'm not quitting!
No!
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
Thank you, sir.
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
The boss is getting hoarse.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
There you are—!
Nothing.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
We just thought that—
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
Stop calling me Mother!
Have you seen this? 
I beg your pardon?
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
You sure you want to know this?
Yes.
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Looks just like it did.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
Oh, hi ...
Bud?
How was your day?
Really Biff? The keenest?
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
I don't believe it.
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
Why am I out of order?
Oh sure it is.
No, not that hedge. The other one.
Lemme see that.
Get lost!
Play along?
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
It's okay.
You're reading?
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
Sure.
Yeah ...
What?
And you're sure about this?
What's going on?
What do we do?
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Yeah ... Sort of ...
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
Right. And how did she dress him?
McIntire's.
McGinty's.
Hello there.
Re-runs?
Oh--well ...
What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
Where's the remote control I gave you?
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
Oh, hi.
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
Dream come true, hunh?
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
Yeah but what are you doing?
Yes, I'll be there.
What's the listing?
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
Please don't.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
Yeah I can't.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
It's not mine.
....no....
...just talking to you....
No.
Really?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
So you think you can?
I didn't lie.
Hello?
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Yeah.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Thank you.
I saw a picture of you.
What do you do with all this pudding?
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
Ok.
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
You like her?
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
I have a better idea of where we can go.
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
Where you married?
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
This is funny.
How many times have you been on an airplane?
Yes I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Did you have my home phone number?
If you wanted to call me back I could...
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Yeah.
Did you do it?
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
Well who did?
Why? ...what?
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
I'll say whatever I want --
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny.
Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
Seriously.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
That's it.
So they'll go.
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
He did seem a little strange.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
They can't be serious.
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
Good day, Marquis.
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
Coulmier, you animal!
I'm here.
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
Well?
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
Of course.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
"A habituè of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
Yes?
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
It's tainted money, Doctor.
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
-- words alone are insufficient.
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
Who are you, sir?
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
There's no call for that language-
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
Why did we not know about this sooner?
Sir?
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
Not for me.
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
The old man has his own way of doing things
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
Let me out.
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
It doesn't have to be
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
They don't have to.
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
It's 350 pages long.
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
Hedy Lamarr?
If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.
Is that from one of the Gospels?
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
Very generous
Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
He's Christ?
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
What's wrong?
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
You wasn't with her, were you?
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
Whatcha doin'?
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
Whadda ya mean?
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
How many pounds I gotta lose?
I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
Nobody. I love you, remember?
That he's got a pretty face.
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
I got bored so I went to the movies.
I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
Are you drunk?
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
And you're drinking with them right now.
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
For instance?
His wife took a trip.
Thanks.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
Your Lisa?
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
Like what?
Congratulations, Jeff.
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
Like what?
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
Jeff --
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
I don't want to.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
We've progressed emotionally in --
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
What do you need money for?
One hundred and twenty-seven.
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
For what?
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
Of course not.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Nothing, thank heaven.
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
What is it you're looking for?
What about it?
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
Inside stuff?
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Is he cleaning house?
Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.
Wasn't that close?
How?
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
L. B. Jefferies.
Hi.
Sure.  It's fine.
Any other entrance?
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
You still want to go home, Moose?
You awake?
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
Son--this is all happening so fast--
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
He's just loaded, honey.
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
Frank!
John Crawford?
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
I'll wait for him.
What?
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
Who's that!
We know.
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
We'll take it!
I don't want you for my father!
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
Just a guard.
Good Lord!
Do I have to spell it out?
Wash up and go home.
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Okay--
Hi.  I saw you before.
See?
Where's Dawson High School?
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
You can't talk underwater!
Hi.
Why?
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
What's he like?
Judy--we're ready for you now.
That one?
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
Read a lot about you, Nick.
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
He wants the money.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
Yeah.
No, no --
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
NO!
Nick --
You're in on this.
Nick...
Don't say my name...
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
Who are you now.
So you could get down her chimney.
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
What'd they call her in high school?
Be more specific.
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
Rather be back in the Mountain?
No.
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
What... Powwow...
...so where is he?
I can't go back to Vegas...
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
What about the Powwow Safe?
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
You want that for here or to go?
What the hell was that about --
How do we take them out?
What about the money?
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
Haven't thought about it.
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Don't move, Rudy!
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
Without having them hit the alarms.
Now where were we?
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
You fuckin' wish.
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Bullshit.
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
Yeah.
What about?
What?
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
Sure.
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
Why am I Mr. Pink?
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
How many employees?
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
That's your proof?
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
So, talk.
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
What happened?
C'mon, throw in a buck.
I don't believe in it.
Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
As opposed to good?
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
What do you think?
How can you be so sure?
Where? Are they out in the car?
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
No shit?
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
Yeah.
I suppose it is.
Are we leaving?
Don't you trust me?
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
What was he in jail for?
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
And meet him there.
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
All right, you didn't know.
Don't act so -- crazy.
But I want to stay.
Even women?
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
Goodbye and thanks.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
What's the use.
Everybody knows --
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
You were supposed to be reading words.
Oh, sure.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
Ouch!!
Oh my God! We're dead!
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
No, stay.
Ray, run faster.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Cindy, let me...
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
Are you okay?
But he'll kill her!
Where's Shorty?
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
Stop touching his brain!
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
Gear. You know, clothing.
Oh.
Uh, uh.
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
What?
That's why we came here, remember?
You do.
That's right.
Alright... I might need your help.
How is she?
Father, are you okay?
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
I woke up naked, too.
BLOOD FEAST!
Did you hear?
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
Chip, your ride is here.
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
"P" as in...
You bitch!
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
So you do drink?
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Are we leaving?
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
How much have you got?
But tell me --
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
I can't understand it at all.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
Well?
Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
What's wrong, Mary?
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
Perhaps.
Cloven hoof?
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
I never thought you did.
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
Yes —— yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
Ann?
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
Mother, father, sister.
I don't know.
No.
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
So what about kids?
Why is that?
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
Aren't you?
Are you in the middle of something?
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
You went out with her?
Why not?
What... what are these interviews about?
About sex?
You just ask them questions?
Maybe you want to go.
That's a good question.
I have money.
Why?
No.
So you lied to her?
If you were in love with me, would you?
Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
Who'd you have lunch with?
You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.
Goddam right.
Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
Did you confront John about the visitor?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
Yes.
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
Yes.
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Well, what, then?
I don't want to talk about it.
Apparently.
Did he touch you?
I can't believe you did that!!
Who are you?
Do I know you?
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
Nope.
Nope.
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
Would anybody else see the tape?
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
Prettier than Ann?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
You know what I mean.
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
Did he put you up to this?
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Not for three-fifty.
Everybody has a past.
Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
Where are the tapes, Graham?
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
Answer him, goddammit!!
IBM.
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Medical clinic?
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
No. I don't think so.
But where are you going?
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
Gonna cut me open?
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
You bet, Bert.
You got it!
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
That's us.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
Sure thing.
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
Poor Brad.
You shouldn't have said that.
You're practically naked!
Vance!  Vance Parker.
. . .For his own good.
Fabulous!
F for...
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
She walks in beauty...
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
How's the trip?
Huh.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
How's it hanging, Miles?
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
Two years ago, buddy.
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
Good. How're you?
Are you a writer too?
I am one of those guys.
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
What?
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
I told you. Filet and salmon.
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
Let me call Christine.
Huh.
When do we get to drink it?
Hey Jack, hurry up!
So you're going to stop acting?
It does. Feels right.
She is very hot.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
How do you know?
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
I want to go home now.
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
Pull yourself together, man.
Where were you?
Right now.
Where is Stephanie?
Does she know about Saturday?
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
Can you give me some room here?
Huh.
Shut up.
What exactly are we going to do?
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
What's up?
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
What?
We gotta go back.
Please, Miles, please.
So what's the plan?
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Want me to drive?
I'm fine. You rest.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
Hi.
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
I had class.
Well, nice to see you now.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Victoria! How the hell are you?
I'm pregnant.
French or American?
This one?
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
It tastes funny.
I don't feel much.
...I will.
Explain noises.
This guy got on the roof in like a second.
What time is it?
I'm sorry, what book is this?
Merrill!
Me too.
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
Yes.
They'll read our minds!
What's that?
What was the first thing?
Is that him?
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Where are we?
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
My name is Emmett.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
Ten A.M.
I haven't done anything.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
No, Leavenworth.
Where's Turley?
You haven't got any money.
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
Yeah?
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
Because they don't like what I want.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
He is now.
Get out of here, Jake.
Now let's talk about you chaps.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
Because they enjoy it.
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
I've given that up.
You've got a legitimate job.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
I'm going to have to look into this.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
And I know what I'm talking about.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
I wouldn't worry about that.
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
Of course.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
The public decides who's on that list.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
The picture's dead.
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
-- I can explain.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
What?... What did you say?
Do what you do to Simone.
Simone?
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
Hello, Hal.
There's... a wall between you --
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
You do?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
I love you, Lainey.
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
-- I bet you have.
Abduction?
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
Taller, Viktor.
Simone, are you there?
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
You mean they buy it?
Maybe he can.
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
Congratulations.
I don't tell her a thing.
Know what?
You said the "s" word.
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
I don't know, Cole.
Are you wigging out?
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
And you know what else?
Yes, Cole?
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
S-ssstop that!
Maybe you don't want to remember.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
You're out of your mind, man.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Harvest moonshining!
How... was she "called?"
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
Sure. What do you want to know.
People say he was a murderer.
-- It's not me!
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Yes!
No --
No Mac, please... I --
I almost thought for a second...
-- Where have you two been?
Where's Mac?
Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
Bill, we need to talk!
And that makes you look like a squid?
Oh, yeah?
How about Brenda?
He tried to kill you, Starla.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
You dig that rat out of the hole?
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
What?
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
I never danced in a towel before.
My present?
Okay.
Who's that?
I'll get if for you.
Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
Where you from?
The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
Jesus!!!
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
You could've asked.
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
No.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
Also boring.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
Breaker. Breaker.
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
And this is your car, isn't it?
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
You woulda?
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
What happened?
His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
Yeah, we've been through that.
Do you want me to say I did it?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
I am. Yeah.
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
...Does he know?
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
...When did you know all this?
Wow.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Yeah... Sid?
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
What's wrong?
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
Listen --
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Why?
What are they?
We're taking a flight?
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
What happened?
He has a point.
Sartorius.
Can you sleep?
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Do you want to stay here?
You should have told me.
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
You want it coming back with us?
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Right.  That's true.
You were reading my Renoir.
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
You asked.
You could do better.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
Oh that thing in Queens.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
You're planning to speak?
Claire...
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
Mike?
What are you talking about?
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
So how'd it go?
I think television's a dangerous thing.
What shit, honey?
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
I'd identify him.
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
It's not your taste.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Why?
What?
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
What're you talking about --
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
You in this with me?
Wasn't your fault.
Bullshit!  Prove it.
She's what?
Sexual tension...
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Jesus Christ.
Lemme down, bugface!
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
Can't focus...
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
An even five I throw in the jacket.
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
Huh?
Does it have a human name?
What are you doing this weekend?
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
Do you mind if I come too?
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
The record--
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
Creation? Or its opposite?
Mr. Parker.
I asked if you felt like a drink--
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Jawohl!
Any news on Dunbar?
Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?
That's right.
Come again?
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
My legs are frozen.
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
Yeah.
What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
It's a mouse trap.
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
Let me go! Let me go!
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
You did?
To the Brick Kremlin!
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
May I have this dance, Miss?
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
We've all done a poor job of it.
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
Go on.
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
We have no radio.
Ich weiss alles.
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
This is me in Cincinnati.
That is my wife.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
Are any of them inhabited?
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
Can you locate them?
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Keep her together until I get back.
Kirk here.
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
No.
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
Is there a problem?
Report.
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
Doctor Soran?
Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
Mr. Chekov -- ?
Will we get another ship?
You did great, Bones... Just great.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
I don't believe it...
... Fascinating.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
Did your collaborator know?
... How long?
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
What? What are you saying?
I know you... Do I not?
The ship... Out of danger...?
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
... The needs of the many outweigh...
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
What I have done, I had to do.
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
They even killed the galley chief.
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
You did this -- in a day?!
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
So are we, it looks like.
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
David. Please.
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
I saw it -- !
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
It's a long story.
It's the Genesis Wave!
Let them eat static.
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Time's up, Admiral...
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
Admiral --
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
Prepare for warp speed.
He's very human.
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
I would accept that as an axiom.
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Hi... Busy?
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
You're joking...!
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
That is what I said, Doctor.
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
Shields, aye.
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
I buy that. What about him?
We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
Do you trust me?
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
Where could you take them?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
... What does that mean?
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
You mean this is -- goodbye?
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
Mr. Spock, your computations?
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
Yes.
Why not?
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
I meant --
The tank will be finished by morning...
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
They did, Admiral.
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
... Aye sir...?
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
Aye, sir. Descending.
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
About 60 feet, Admiral.
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
I notice you're still working with polymers.
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
But not you.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
Sometimes I do.
The artificial lifeform was right?
Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
And our people?
Are they in any danger?
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
You're not going to launch anything until...
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
A planet in Federation space...
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
Do you know how they were damaged?
I don't believe it happened that way.
You got me, Commander.
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
My name is Sojef, Captain.
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
I wish there was a way to bring them back home.
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
Come out, come out wherever you are...
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Scanners are off line!
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
Counselor?
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Or you could try lying down.
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
Yes...
You think they're still up there?
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
Isn't it better like this...?
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
Dispersive armor is holding.
Juice?
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
Their com system must still be down.
Main bus...
Ready.
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
Jean-Luc Picard.
What do you want?
What?
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Why?
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Track their weapons fire.
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
Target locked!
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
We've lost Bridge control!
Worf to Bridge.
Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
Admiral Donald...Bill...
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
Good luck, Captain.
Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge.
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
Damned clever if you ask me...
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
They'll respect him now...
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
Well, I -
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
I am.
Where IS the conference?
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
Aye, sir.
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
Thank you, Captain.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
Your friends are late...
And your coat.
Where do we come in?
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Kronos, sir?
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Sir?
Just the prototype.
WE SURRENDER.
Faith...?
What?
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
And if they're still in place?
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
Can you remember our father?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
What do you imagine this is?
Ready, Captain.
How long until we reach the fleet?
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
We are losing dorsal shields.
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.
How can you be certain?
But how can he? He'll kill you.
I'm only half human.
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
Sir?
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
Sir, we won’t be able to bring you back. It’s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
Sir, we're being hailed.
Understood.

Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
To find the head, sir?
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Sir --
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
Strength in numbers?
Report.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you’d be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
Why am I here?
Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
I am.
So they’ve got him up and running.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Find her again.
No -- this is wasting time.
How long?
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
Benny, there's nothing there.
You have one with two beds?
Make any money?
Where did you stop last?
Elmo's...
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
I just retired.
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Gear shift.
Money.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
Horses.
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
Three nights... two days.
No.
Say it.
Jennyhaydn.
Yes?
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
You can have one.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
I must meet my ship.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
You can stop. I will go on alone.
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
I don't know where he is.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
You have no conception of this, do you?
Was there visual contact?
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
You know that's impossible!
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
Leave him alone, Tran.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
Damn right.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
What's going on?
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
He's been cooked-off
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
Where's Faith?
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Forget her.
Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
No it doesn't.
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
It was a tough call.
Alright.  We're going up.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
You must travel a lot, huh?
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Look, mister...
What did he look like?
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
He said it was a clue?
Chuck, hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
From the grave?
You refused to comply with a direct order.
I'll take it into consideration.
I don't believe this.
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
I was looking for a pattern.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
Miss me, Dave?
None taken.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
And you're working with him?
Does one exist?
I'd be real careful if I were you.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
Agent Mackelway?
Suspect Zero?
Was it Zero?
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
I know, I know.
I don't know about that.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
You're a comedian?
Are you sure? Maybe...
Hi.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
I thought I was going to die.
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Oh. You know.
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
...not until you book it...
...and even then...
They're out of Glenlivet.
The poor thing. Six years?
...And she's with someone else.
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Why not?
It's a rebound.
...It's really getting late.
...Six months.
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
Unless she comes back first.
There's the rub.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
That doesn't sound too good for business.
Kinda money, huh?
Darwinism at its best.
Thanks, man.
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
Well, you're doing so well...
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
She was cute.
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
Don't call me ever again.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
I'm not going to Vegas.
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
That's not cool.
Did she, or did she not smile?
You think they're watching?
You gotta do it.
Yea, how much?
What an asshole.
She likes you.
I don't know...
...Baby...
Whatever.
No!
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
What?!?
I hear she's getting real fat.
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
Was I money?
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
No.
...shivering...
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...you're money...
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
You dick.
...Sue...
It's on.
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.
Godfather!
What was that?
Yeah.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
For bravery.
And this?
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
You want him to stay in this country.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
You tell us about America.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
What about McCluskey?
I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
Michael, what are those men doing?
Yes.  Tell me.
Huh?
Please say it.
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
When will I see you again?
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
A million times.
Buy me out?...
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
Well, we ate everything without you.
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
I don't like you.
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
It's just an undercoat. 
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
Your parents met her.
No! I've got more than one shirt!
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
Do you have any brothers?
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
What club?
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
I thought you'd missed the train.
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
That's good.
Why?
Tom, I don't love you.
Freddie, do you have something to say?
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
Dickie!
I'll go and see what's the matter.
What does that mean?
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
Hello Marge!
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
Why? When?
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
I told you! I knew it!
How would you know that?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
Ten thirty?
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Tom, are you okay?
Even her.
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
Does he stay with you here?
No!
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
How much for everything.
Is there a firing range around?
Huh?
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
Well, we're all working tonight.
What did you do?
The moon?
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
The DMZ?
You must be rich.
It keeps ya busy.
Oh. Who was that again?
What's wrong?
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
Keep it.
Travis?
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge...
Yeah.
Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.
For a fee.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
Well... I guess so.
What's your name?
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
What's your real name?
I don't like my real name.
I don't remember.
Don't you want to go?
Well, I tried.
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
I... I don't get along with people like that.
Do I look like a narc?
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
What do you mean?
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
You want to work uptown nights?
Twenty-six.
Is that so?
I'm hip.
O.K., cowboy.
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Well yes I suppose ...
What are you doing?
Mason.  Mason?
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Well...
What.
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
They're not bad.
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Sir, that is true.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
I'm a little hesitant to say.
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
Good to meet you.  Again.
A super market.  Huh.
Harry, son.  Harry.
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
Ernie.
You bet.
Well...
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
Any idea how you got here, son?
Call me... Ishmael?
Evening, Luke.
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
Exactly.
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
Yeah, well, that's enough.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
What do you mean?
Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
The customers?  I don't know...
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
Yes.  Very.
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?
Yes?
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
Yes.
If you have some, I'd...
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
I see.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
I did.
Do you think I should go?
Mom, they're in a cage!
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Why are they trying to kill people?
That's where the Brenners live.
I see. How do I get down there?
Mmmm.
I wonder if you could tell me...
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Lovebirds, I see.
When?
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
We won't be here.
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
I couldn't ask you to.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
Does this room look silly?
Well... yes, sir, there are.
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
Right next to the one you already had.
He was watching a ball game on television.
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
Yes.
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
But you tore it up.
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
I do different things on different days.
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
It was like that yesterday.
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
Mitch...
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Maybe! Is it impossible?
Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
I want you to help my little girl.
It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
What's that you say?
See that, Fettes?
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
Not yet.
The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
I want it --
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
It might be an interesting case.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
I've had some experience.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
The nerve centers -- the brain --
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
This is a gift.
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
Yes.
"A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like."  Ah, how he cozened them.
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
Nearly a year.
Yes, Doctor.
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
We won't.
Two down. Two to go.
You think I'm crazy.
I was hoping you'd find out.
Where the fuck did you come from?
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
I told you, I knew your sister.
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
I know.
I want you... to bend over.
Honey. I just can't.
Erin!
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
About you.
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
Did you have a nice day, dear?
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
You think they'll ever find him?
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
No -- I'm afraid not.
No foolin'? Will you?
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
I will be in just a minute.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
Everyone seems so-- 
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
Who?
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
I don't like horror comics.
What?...
With him?
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
Or a vampire.
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
What happens in tow and a half hours?
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Smells good.  When do we eat?
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Are we havin' fun or what?
I thought we were goin' into town.
Did we have a date tonight?
You like Michael.
He looks dead.
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
I thought we were poor.
Where's Michael?
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Something the matter?
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
Did you spill something?
Mom's home?...
What about Mom?
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
Sixteen.
What was he doing in the rec room?
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
Was dark... find a light...
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
What do we do about those three?
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
You ain't tying me up.
Anything?
Well, who's got access to it?
How many in their party?
Hey, man...!
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
Why?
That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
Then we go after him.
You jerking off or just pissed?
Get your gear on.
What's happened?!
MacReady...?
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
Sir... have you a name?
My God... I saw this.
It frightens you.
Yes.
The air... the power.
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
I won't leave you like this.
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
How?
And what of the Eloi?
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
But you've earned a reward for your valor.  I think you should become. You'll like it here.  Once you get used to the darkness.
I don't think that's going to happen.
Why is it -- breaking up?
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
You know I can't.
Holding you... again.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
How long did you travel?
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Yes!
This is magnificent...
What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
How do you decide?
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
You liked it there.
It must have been safe.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
Yes... I suppose so.
Go back to your own time?
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
We don't know.
What do you mean?!
If I might explain, sir --
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
They're inside --
You ok?
Then don't.
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
That's too bad.
And what's that?
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
That's too bad.
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
What should they be looking for?
Sure.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Yeah, but I don't know what.
But I like it I guess.
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
How'd he die?
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
But no one knew until after...
[Beat] You bled to death.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
I have no idea.
You're sure?
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
You were convicted of the crime.
You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
What case?
[Beat] I don't know.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
Exactly.
You don't understand.
I did?
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
I'm not sure.
Why "of course"?
You want a drink?
[Beat] I do it.
Hon?
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
Honey?
On what?
In the leg.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
Alright.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
Tell us about him.
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
Armed robber.
Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!
Oh shit.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
I'm a robber.
You're a bank robber?
Where'd y'all go?
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
What?
Hello...
Who is it?
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
How come he let you go?
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Oh my God.
Shit!  I... I, which way?
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
It means shut up, Thelma.
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
That's puttin' it mildly.
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
How do I look?
What's wrong with you?
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
What for?
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
Now what?
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
You mean now or before?
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
This is so beautiful.
Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.
What?
Thelma!
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!
About two hundred and fifty miles.
I'm not apologizing for shit!
Are you going to apologize or not?
He implied it.
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
Never?
Whatever happened to Mary?
Why not?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Uh-huh.
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Mints?
Why's that?
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
A fucking moron.
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
Don't play games with me, Ted.
You want her dead, don't you?
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
I think your life's about to change.
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
Oh my.
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Your turn?
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Thanks for picking me up.
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Hm?
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
No I'm not.
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
An old flame?
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Ted, are you okay?
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Hi, Ted.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
What?! No please, sir --
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
Ho there.
So what's up?
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
My father --
All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
Yeah?
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
When are you going to be home?
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
James Looks Twice?
What's this about?
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
Were you in Nam?
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
How'd you know?
Go ahead.
What'd she say?
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
Ray...
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
It's not real.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Not no more.
What are you talking about?
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Well, it was just a dream, I --
Sorry.
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
This Clear Moon's house?
You take care.
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
Ray. X22.
Do you want a coffee?
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?
Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
It's what?
Yes, ma'am.
Where were you?
If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
No.
Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something.  I'm sorry.
Evan... or Maverick.
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
How about anything, anything you want to do.
Used to what?
I'm different.
Let's make it at eight.
It dies. We live.
You're an animal.
Danger?
...they say you're alright.
I was flying...my responsibility.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
It does.
What truth?
What does it mean?
That's three.
I was, later.
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Tomcats?
Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
What are you doing?
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
Just relax.
Did what?
So's my Johnson.
What was that?
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
We did it!
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Something bothering you?
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
Time to go.
3000 feet. I'll do it.
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
I was a victim of circumstance.
They should have warned you about that one.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
ON THE NOSE?
I guess I owe you one.
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
I've seen this before.
What the hell you doing?
You won?!!!
Sir?
Yes sir.
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
Oh, you mean the thrill!
How do you feel?
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
You think I shouldn't fly.
Would you take me back? Would they?
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
I'll go encode your room key.
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
What the fuck is going on down there?!
Now let's get down to business.  Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --Do you think you can play along?
Stop fighting and get out.
I'm listening.
Amazing.  Where are we?
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Not since you lost him.
Why not?
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Let me go!
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?
What are you doing?
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
Oh God, Doug.
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
And falling in love?
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
I'm honored.
Nice to meet you.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
What's he talking about?
I guess he didn't.
...What?
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Don't be ridiculous.
So you dropped by to apologize?
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
What can I do?
Like what?
I gave you?
...Who are you?
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
Yeah, like they got a plan...
What the hell is that, anyway?
Burt, can you hear me now?
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Jeez, look at that guy.
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Its tires are flat...
<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.
It worked!  There they go!
True.
It most certainly is.
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
Haven't heard that one before, Ed.  But I guess I'll be hearing it again.
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
You're implying that I planted a gun?
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
-- an angel dust dealer --
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
Eddie... What's a DD-5?
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
A fucking wheelchair?
Figures.
Exactly what happened then?
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
It was self-defense.
'lo, Cecil.
See-cil.
No, s-sir.
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
No.
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
Shu's the only one I know of...
Get lost Bobby.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
It's 4:30. We close at five.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
Anything else?
Sorry to hear it.
Any friends?
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
Accidental?
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
Maybe.
Laura?
What are you doing?
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
How did the car get back here?
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
Nice night.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
No... No...
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
Hiking?
No.
Eating?
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
I always thought you knew it was me.
I don't know.
What's wrong?
There's no one here.
Come back as soon as you can.
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
How did you settle on the amount?
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
You know what that would mean?
This is going to drive the ante up.
What does it mean?
That's not my handwriting.
I thought I would need it.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
Through, through his book.
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...that's all right.
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
That's what I'd planned to...
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
Right. Who called?
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Who told you that?
I used to be a nurse.
Yes...
Yessir. I'm sorry.
...things change.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.  I myself would take it and run like a thief.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.
Exception!
D'you find an apartment?
I changed my life today. What did you do?
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
Would you like me to leave...?  Is this a bad time -- ?
What happened...?
You're going to stay here...?
Yes.
If I don't 'grow up...'
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
No.
Hello, I'm calling from...
Pardon?
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
You know, you're pushy, fella...
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
...I'm going to need your help...
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
You use their witness.
That's right.
Are you with me... are you awake...?
What the hell are you doing here?
I just saw her.
What happened in those three...
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
It was...  ...one of them!
What was it like?
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
It's about that meteor.  They say it's a whopper.  The District Officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. Thought you might be interested... It's ten or twelve miles from here - over by Linda Rosa.
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
So?
So I don't know about horror.
Like Freddy.
No.
No.
Doctor...
Someone's coming.
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
What...what is that?
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
I want to see the body.
Studio B.
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
Why didn't you drop any sail?
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
Gieg, Chuck.
What do you mean?
I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You satisfied?!
You're not a moron.
Congratulations.
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
Is it true Phil?
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
What the hell is going on?
Jesus.
Fine.
What'd you do?
My parents don't do it anymore.
How do you know?  They might.
Where are you from any way?
It works?
Jesus, you never told them?
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
The Dolphin was a symptom.
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
No.
What is it we can do for you today?
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
What's that?
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
Why, man?
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
It hurts too much to care.
Do you have something to say?
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
No.
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
And you didn't do anything about it?
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
Why? He's right in the groove.
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
How 'bout a beer?
That'd be fine, Bobby.
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
What's that?
She really say she was pregnant?
Told ya I would. You still riled?
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
Mostly black though in that boogie place.
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
The Good Witch...
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday.
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
What's that, peanut?
Actin' funny how?
What's that?
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
Got anyplace special in mind?
What's that, honey?
Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?
It's just another case, Sailor.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
What was this one?
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
Lula, you there?
You think she's gonna make it?
And no AC.
You find any work?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
You talk to 'im some?...
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
Damn!
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Take care of him?
Just tell me what you want.
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Santos...
No.
In the head.
Yes.
No... But...
I know... I remember.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
She's still a transvestite.
I thought you were tinkering.
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Tripp?!
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Kidnapped? By who?
How bad is it for you?
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
The Chancellor's here? Now?
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
I've been doing that a lot lately.
You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.
Her dog, yes.
Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
Who's got a gun?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
Yea, James.
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
Can I ask you something about her?
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
Who?
What'd you tell him?
But... ?
But James. I mean... How long?
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
Isn't this...?
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
Maybe she didn't come here.
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
I never said that.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
I'm not going with them.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
Get out of here.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
So what are you going to do?
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
Jesus.
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
I'm sure.
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
You don't deserve me, you know.
Listen, Antonia --
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
Grady?
Maybe I should read it.
Where you stand?
I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."
A jockey? You mean, like --
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
Are you riding with me, James?
Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
No shit.
But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
How is she?
What are you doing?
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
It wasn't like that.
Then what? What?!
I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
Soon.
Isn't it?
Is that right?
Their sound is quite musical.
I can't.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
I have to go.
My daddy likes me home before dark.
See anything interesting?
What does that mean?
Then you won't mind if I look around.
They grow outside, don't they?
Do you believe in them?
You knew her?
Know what?
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
I'm adjusting okay.
Are you taking your medication?
It gives me headaches.
I'm twelve.
I can't.
How do you know?
Walter?
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
No way.
That's right.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
Is that what you are angry about?
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
How long is this going to take?
I mean, when will I be normal.
You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
When did it all start?
You mean my problem?
That's not a helpful answer.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
What the hell are you doing there?
Time.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
What?
I'll buy a plant.
You must hate it.
Something happened to you.
Tell me about it.
I suffer from insomnia.
Why do you want to know?
The worst?
What did you do to them?
Why don't you just go now, okay?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
What?
I was always the one seduced.
You really believe that?
You must hate your brothers.
Are you serious?
I'm not scared.
Just think about it.
I've got problems.
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
No.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
Well, that's that.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
It is insane.
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
Why bring it here?
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Hippy, you pussy.
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.
Stand by on the ROV.
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
Well, what?
There's nothing much to laugh at.
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
But where did you finally end up?
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. Is that clear?
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
Where is she going?
Giulia...
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
And do you remember where she got off?
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
You've made some mistake there with the bushes... that's why you can't finish it.
You really must do me this one favor.
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
Why?
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
Who told you this?
Look at the statues, they're thin.
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
Let's talk about something else.
First thing that comes to your mind?
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
He's told you?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
Do you remember the night they said it came?
Where?
I fell asleep.
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Anything?
How did she know that?
Who?
Agnes...
No.
Why not?
Because I don't want one.
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
Sometimes, yes.
She watches... she listens.
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
That you're a mistake?
Her headaches.
Yes I am.
You're a mistake.
Doctor Livingston.
Of telling you.
Did you want it to come out?
Will she be angry?
I'm afraid.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
What is it?
What else?
Do you know who put it there?
For me to get sick in.
Why isn't anyone coming?
Yes.
I hate him for what he did to me.
I hate him.
I put her to sleep.
H... how?
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
Look into the convent records.
Eve, she strangled a baby!
Why?
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
You have proof?
No!
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
No-one.
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
What man had access to her?
And you didn't try to find out who?
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
And you weren't shocked?
She has it now.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
I'm only interested...
Aquittal.
Visitors to the convent.
Nothing.
What is it?
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
Yes.
Listening to angels?
I haven't decided yet.
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
Fine thanks...
Long, thin and filtered.
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Hand rolled.
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
Do you want to become one?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
May I be present?
Of course.
For the Church?
She's been touched by God, yes.
My God, you're as crazy as...
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Somebody told her.
I'm concerned about her health.
This is permission to take her apart.
Who knew she was pregnant?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
You wanted that child out of the way.
Oh, don't do this!
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
They are?
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
You heard, it gets on my wick.
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Oh, it's all right.
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
Well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...
Ever seen one of these before?
Of course I can.
I beg your pardon?
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
Sure. .
We do.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
You haven't, you're just late.  Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
Should I say it?
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...
The big hammer?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
Is she?
And cunning.
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
Parading?
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
A book!
You're only right.
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
What are you doing?
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
Hiding.
That little old man.
How d'you reckon that one out?
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
Ah, go on, you swine.
I'll brook no denial!
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
No, I'm not.
Oh yes.
He's betrayed the class.
Well!
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
Aren't we ...
Yeah, you want to watch it.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
I feel like shit...
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
Do you remember the pyramid?
I got it.  Oh boy.
Can you get it a little closer?
Gravity?
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Just machinery.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
Can we come up?
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
Why, what's wrong?
But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
Might even incinerate the damn thing.
Where did it come from?
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
What?  What was that?
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
What common objects?
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
Blow the ship up?
What's the frequency?
I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.
That way.
It won't come -- it's stuck.
I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
That tube must be depositing it in him.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
What the hell happened?
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you on my board.
Found what?
Where did the parasites come from?
We won't need it then.
Food-storage room!
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
I'll get you out of there.
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
It's too late!
How much air-time have I got?
Deal.
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
Forget it, man.
What the hell are you doing?
Alright, okay.  Look...
Hold it, hold it...
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
They've changed their heading again.
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
Yeah.  Somebody won.
Agreed.
Hurry it up.
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
You know me better than that.
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
She never proved anything, not a thing!
Then say so.
Yes, Addison.
I don't think I'm going.
Feeling better, my dear?
Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer?
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
Didn't you know?
Frankly, I don't remember.
I take it she read well.
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
Bill...
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Bill!
Huh?
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.
Like a nylon lemon peel-
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
That I am...
Many happy returns of the day...
Need any help?
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
So she seems.
What fire and music?
I will not calm down!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
Margo, let's make peace.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
It's not nonsense.
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
"Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that I speak with you. Please" - it's underlined - "meet me in the Ladies' Room. Eve."
A married lady.
- little things here and there, it doesn't matter. You can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be.
Is that what you want me to be?
Lemme fix you a drink.
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
The same size?
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
Adorable. We now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop.
No.
I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
You probably won't believe me.
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Hello, Miss Channing.
Try...
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
May I have your coat?
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
Let's not get over-dramatic.
I'm not crying.
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
Addison wants me to play it.
Not at all...
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
You've what?
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
Margo, really...
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
He's in love with you.
Well...
Coming?
That's quite a change of subject.
I'm beginning to catch up.
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
Such as?
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
How do you mean?
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
I'm sure.
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
I mean really, deeply angry...
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
Promise.
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--it was fine the way it was--
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
Hmm.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
--a spy, you mean?
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
Think Sloan's back?  What's wrong?
--shit--
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
He'll give us a sworn statement.
I think that's him.
It's nothing personal, though. 
--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
What does it say?
Morning or night?
--Howard Hunt?
And you will.  But not now.
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
--that was awhile ago--
Speak.
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
To cover up?
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
What's this?
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
Security consultant.
It may never come out.
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
I couldn't say.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
Whaddya got, whaddya got?
That was awhile ago.
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
--look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?
Thanks coach.
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
This.  Right now.
Why is this?
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
Do I have to?
Nice car.
You don't like it?
Stifler told me.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
No comment.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
What the heck is this?
You're not...busy?
Okay.
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Dad.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
Don't you want me to?
Who cares?
I'll just say that we had a great night together.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
Yes.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
God dammit, Stifler!
Like how?
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
Yeah.  Are you sure?
What?!  How do I do that?
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Bullshit.  From where?
The key is don't look down.
Tell you what, we'll jump together.
Merde! I can't believe this!
I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
Fan-fucking-tastic?
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
I don't know...
Didn't even have to ask.
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
Pull over! Now!
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
Alright. Let me write a letter.
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 
Andy!
Merde.
Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
Where is your home, Anya?
Who's Sophie?
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
How do you know?
I'm getting a chest cold..
See? The Princess is under there ...
I'll show you!
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
I should go
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
This guy's on television.
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
Who are you?
What do you mean, next?
Why not?
Tsch.
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
Nice car.
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
Yeah.
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
You sure?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, sorry.
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Well, who's Sadie?
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
God bless.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
Yeah.
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Okay.
We can digest our-
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
H'm?
Hey?
Yeah?
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
Yeah.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
Are yuh?
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
Who cares? Who cares?
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
M'hm.
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
There's a spider in the bathroom.
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
Yeah.
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
I don't know.
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
Remember that day?
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
You catch Dylan?
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
Probably on their first date, right?
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Yes.
Whatta you mean?
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Right, Max. California, Max.
Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
Max, I've got a hit series.
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
V.P.L.?
His wife has diabetes!
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.
Oh.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
A long time.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Was it a contractor?
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
The movie.
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
Any thoughts on casting yet?
Scratch the two, write in a four.
You don't have any clothes on.
Didn't I say?
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
He's gonna miss his flight.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
Fuck you.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
Leave us alone right now.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
We closed.
We've only been over this how many times?
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Yes.
Did he promise?
Through the sweats or not?
Dolphins.  Great.
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
Otis!
I don't look my age, Joe.
This is insanity.  Sally...
No.
That's under lock and key.
I know.
We have a gift?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
Do I put you off?
What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
You're an interior decorator, right?
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
Lemon.
That's very nice.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
I didn't say a word.
They're nothing like us.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
Ready to go?
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
Yes.
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
Yeah.
Like your business managers?
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
I wasn't finished.
Okay.
I'm worried about your Galiano.
I didn't know you had this.
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
Like Joe.
I hope they're watercolors!
Hm.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
Invisible!
Someone who follows his heart!
Really?
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Want a list?
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
What do you see out there?
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
You're a real buddy.
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
Shall we say -- a dollar?
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
Would you like to?
Eight-thirty.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'Bye.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
No -- I like it.
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
Something wrong with your legs?
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
I am. Let me get the cards.
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
I don't want it.
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
Pick up your cards and let's go.
I would.
There's a call for you --
Are we dressing for dinner?
How's everything at the apartment?
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
Oh.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Mind if I come in?
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
What for?
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
Mine?
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
Now hold on, Baxter --
On account of me.
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
Mr. Sheldrake?
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
Me?
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
How do you spell her last name?
Help yourself.
Can you use a bottle of champagne?
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
And what happened to you?
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Let me take that.
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
Okay. I'm sorry.
Are you sure that's what you want?
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
Lovely. You were a big help.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
My men --
Esprit de corps --
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
No.
Yeah. Way north.
Yeah.
And the grass?
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
We could go in tomorrow at dawn -- there's always off-shore wind in the morning.
I --
Anybody see some smoke ?
They nail him for it bad ?
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
What does that mean ?
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
Charlie?
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
No, sir.
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
What's your name, sailor ?
Wh -- what?
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --
Haiphong.
Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
Hairy ?
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
Why did you come to ... my province.
Do you know me?
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
Do you?
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
Go away -- hide yourself.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
Which one's the Colonel's?
You think he'd of shot us?
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
That's me.
You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
Cognac?
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
Yes.
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
215  CONTINUED:
165  CONTINUED:  
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Be careful, okay?
What's going on?
I'll tell you everything later.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
Where's my ELT?
Don't bet on it.
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
Get the fuck out of here.
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
...Ben never sent a signal.
This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
How was it talking to him?
How long has he been having problems?
I know. He's just the best.
So what are you doing with a dog?
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
So you'll be at work?
No... no thank you notes.
Lovely.
Two days.
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Nonsense!
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
And?
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Fries.
It's one idea...
I don't want to hear that music right now.
Were you asleep?
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Why? What have you been thinking about?
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
No touch. No touch. No touch.
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Shall I get her for you?
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
Melvin...
What did she say?
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
So you're practically finished, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
Bain.  Michael Bain.
Tachlinkov.
What does that fucking mean?
You would be.
How did he know?
Deadline?
Okay.  How did you find me?
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
He wants to kill you?
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
Because I'm done.
How did you get into the business?
Ahhhh...
They tried to kill you?
Several.
I don't know.
Do you think about the game?
Yes.
No.
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
Breakfast.
You should knock.
Sorry.
But he won't shoot you right then?
We split the money?
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
Yes.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
No.
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
Are you attracted to me?
Yes.
What happened to her?
Were you attracted to me right away?
Uh-huh.
Why?
That doesn't sound normal.
Do you ever think about starting over?
It's possible.
I hope not.
You mean quit?
That's correct.
Cheers Katka!
How to make a buck!
But we are underground?
Anything in it?
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.
What did the beer cost?
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
That makes you an expert I guess.
Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
No....The Asylum!
Can you do the lock on it?
It must be on the other side of this.
I'd love to get in there.
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
Destroy the evidence huh.
Perfect!
Let's split.
Do you think anyone will really come here?
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
Red or white?
No, We aren't going to do it.
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
It just happened.
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
Siberia.
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
That one?
Doug?
No!
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Sure. Excellent.
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
No way Doug, I can't.
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
I don't understand, it's your home?
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.
How?
A champion of lost causes huh?
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
I had it coming from someone.
Run into Josh?
That's right.
And a fifty foot extension lead?
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
Shall I look after the rest?
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
What if his accomplices have made copies?
It could help with a new car --
Out with Belinda?
You look nice. I should have dressed.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
Now it's okay?
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
I don't make small talk --
Were?
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
You got some kind of list?
I'll take a chance.
Go for it.
It's private.
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
You don't believe in anything?
Oh. Just not at school...
It's a start.
She great or what?
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
Stand right here.
Loved?
Assholes. This happen to you?
What's wr--?
Mars.
Ergo?
From citizen high to citizen low.
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
What are you thinking?
How you doing?
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
This week.
Yes.
Where did you get -- ?
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
A similar triangle?
How old are you?
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
Fine..
Learn anything?
How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
Not a holocaust --
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
What?!
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
So what? We'd be rich!
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
My guess is that she turned him down.
Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
Suzy!
Well, he's gone.
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
Don't you ever get bored around here?
You lost that one?
Well, Kit...
What're you doing?
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Holly.
Nah, I got me a job.
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
He'll say that?
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
Well, stop the world.
I know.
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
How's he doing?
You tired?
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
Have you got a better idea?
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
New Jersey?
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
Let her out. In my custody.
All accounted for?  Where's Penny?
Got a casualty list?
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Go where?  Where're you going?
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
But John Whorfin said kill her.
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Is, uh... Is he okay?
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
I want to know!
Hah!
Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity – the basest coin there is.
What else?
...Huh? No, I'm –
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps – this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
A souse!
I didn't say anything-
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
Go ahead, son.
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if – well I know I sometimes run on.
Howdy, neighbor.
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
Yeah, but –
You're leaving?
No... Can I come in?
I'm at the Earle.
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
Fink.
Yes sir, they –
Must be.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Physician, heal thyself.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
Excellent picture.
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".
Yes.
You okay?
Catherine Tramell.
We were in some of the same classes.
Who?
You did it for me.
What is this interest you've got in her?
What do you want, Nick?
She told you, didn't she?
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
How long were you dating him?
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
I found Lisa Henderson.
Why not?
You workin' on another book?
Yes I am.
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
Thanks.
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
I don't know.
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
Everybody that she plays with dies.
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
So what do we do -- nothing?
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen.  They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
It's in New York.
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
Yeah – I'd do that... You could teach me.
Do you still love her?
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
They're just words.
Yes, I understand – but where do you take them from?
What?
I'm not black.
You're not?
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Paint it out.
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
Your people.
Check you later, man.
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
... I'll buy you some new ones.
You're back.
I hadn't thought about it.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
What's that about?
It's three thousand dollars!
Hi.
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
Can you put me in the ring with him?
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
So what?
So shut up and keep painting..
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?
'Phillips head,' right?
Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
I will relay the message.
A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
I can't sleep either, lately.  A little link, between us.  But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it.  That could put a strain on our relationship.
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
Your blood, Max.
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
Ten, nine...
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
Wonder if it's worth my time.
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
But I can't can I?
It's good to see you.
Alfred, are you...?
I'm on break from-
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
You think Freeze will take the bait?
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
I see you knew him.
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
Dick, don't push me right now.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
Then you never loved me?
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
Scholarly research?
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
The _Rolls_?
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
What's wrong?
My life's an open book. You read?
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Wait. You can't go.
Just ones this beautiful.
Wacko? That a technical term?
He sure did.
Why do you do that?
Touchy, touchy.
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
Holy shit.
Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
A-14.
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
What are you talking about?
I'll have to ask you for that film.
Please.
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
I loathe bats.
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
What now?
All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
I suggest a nice big bomb.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
Boss! Jesus! They've --
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
I understand.
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
Nice snap, huh?  Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
You are on drugs.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
HOLY SHIT!!
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it ....
And what did you say?
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
There were three strawberries.
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
Meaning?
Let's get a coffee.
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
Annie, it's me.
Right first time.
And howls Alison?
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Ahm....
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Bye, Dad.
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
Doctor Jacobson?
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
Huh? Huh huh.
Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever gonna score?
Turd-burglar...
Bunghole...
Butt-snatch...
Uh... butt-snatch...
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Oh yeah. Can you just take us to Washington? We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
You see what I see, Bork?
I see it. I don't get it.
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
Do her? Huh huh.
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
You scored with two chicks?!
Uh, ten uh...
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
She's ready.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
What happened?
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
Little black party dresses?
What...?
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
You don't have an appointment, do you?
Aren't you dead?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
We have to start simpler, is that it?
Just get some people out of our house.
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
About what?
If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Yes.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Dad.  Do you believe me?
... sheets.
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
They're... not here anymore.
I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
Are they suffering?
It wasn't a joke.
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
Maybe Charles does.
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
Thank you.
I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
... He's gone, Chauncey.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Yes. He's a very careful driver.
Did you lose something?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...
Hello, Eve.
Thank you, Eve.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
I see.
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
Ben is very ill.
Yes, I understand.
I certainly do.
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
I feel very good in here.
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Thank you, Ben.
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. Of men and women.
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
... Evening, Chance.
I see.
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Compensated...?
No, I do not have any of those.
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  He has one just like it.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
... Nothing.
Try again.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
No, that won't do any good.
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
Clearly, yes comrade.
This is not what I requested.
Right, Chief.
So...? Where the hell is it?
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
I never played a jewel thief.
Enjoy.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Did you eat?
Yeah. You want a beer?
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
I know.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
So how was it?
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
Pardon?
Schwartz.
Yex?
I said "yes."
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
Yes, well...
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
What'll you have?
No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
This is important!
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
Tickets to Malkovich?
Sure. It'd be fun.
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
You're evil, Maxine.
Lotte, this is so good...
Let him try.
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
What kind of circumstances?
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
But I think I have another plan.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Says me. Do you dream often?
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
No.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
Yes?
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
How do we do that?
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Darling!
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
Then what do I do?
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
WILL YOU STAY?
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
Don't pay to complain.
She gone like they say?
Well, if you want my opinion...
Yes sir
I miss her.
In case of what?
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
No...no...no..
True.
Better ask Paul D.
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
Till she showed herself.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
What run him off? Tell me that!
You?
Leave off..
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Hiya Allan.
Fuck.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
The Gundersons.
The?  Who the fff--
Yeah, it sucks.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY!
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
Sheesh.
I was bowling--
I am the Walrus.
Burkhalter.
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
I'm shomer shabbas.
Those are good burgers, Walter.
Uh-huh.
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Nancy's pretty good.
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
Heh-heh--
Color?
And was there anything of value in the car?
Far from it.
Take it easy, Dude.
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
Is that what that's a picture of?
Huh?
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
And please don't call her my mother.
Now I got--
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Uh-huh.
What happened to your house?
Theodore Herzel.
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
Hey man--
Well, just take 't easy, man.
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
That...fucking...bitch!
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
What the fuck is going on there?
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
FUCK.
Wooden bridge, huh?
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
That makes me feel all warm inside.
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
Wha. . . Donny--
Walter--
Dude here.
Did I urinate on your rug?
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Employed?
WHAT?!
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
What?
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
Like cancer with a purpose.
Why do you hate us so much?
How does it look?
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
Nomak?
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Going on twenty years now.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Get in. You’re leaving.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
You're not going anywhere.
You're too human, Blade.
Why?
But, he could've --
You're hurt --
Some. It's been slow --
I know. Take some of my blood.
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
LaMagra --
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
--and if she ever did--
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
No.
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
I think we get the gist.
Was that you laughing?
Whatever you want.
Why?
I know, I know.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Beer and weed is what I've got.
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--
There, what? I didn't see anything.
Can't you like just divine it?
You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.
Yeah?
Fire escape??
Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
Hold this.
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
Let's get inside.
Running a junk yard.
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
It's Domini, it's not Domini, I don't care--all I know is <u>I'm</u> not dealing with something--<u>anything</u>-- snuffing me in my sleep. I want to do what we did in the woods-- surveillance of this whole place 24/7, with somebody monitoring those cameras every second. There's something, somebody here, I want to see 'em coming.
What're you nuts--
Pointless.
The four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands, don't you?
At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.
Elly Kedward?
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
--a <u>lot</u>.
Shoot.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Domini's the only logical explanation.
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
"It's why the witch kills children."
What the fuck's going on here?
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
Abby. What's the matter?
Well... the couch would be all right...
...Huh?
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Ray--
...You know that car?
Back where?
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Yeah.
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
What?
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Bull.
No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey nothing.
Nobody.
Shit. You better tell me something.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
Well.
THEN WHAT?
Yes.
No. What is happening?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Nice guy.  Who's he?
Look.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Yes. Frank-
What do you want to do?
Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
Come on Dorothy.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I love you Don with all my heart.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
You called me Jeffrey.
I'll call you.
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
What?
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Yes.
That's too bad.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
Where are they?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Are you alright?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
Why not?
Yeah.
What did you see?
You want a Dairy Queen?
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
You saw a lot in one night.
Yes.
Goodnight.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
You worry about me really?
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
No.
Look Jeffrey.
Good to see you, son.
How ya doin' Dad?
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Come on out a minute, okay?
Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
Motherfucker works fast.
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
What is?
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
What?  Yeah, sure.
Excuse me?
We want some grass.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
No.
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
What's that?
I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.
Because I got caught.
Oh my G-d.
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
But you must.  It's the only way.
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
Are you comfortable with this?
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
Surprised to see me?
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
It's a family heirloom.
It would be my pleasure.
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
Family.
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
What are you going to do?
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
I don't think so.
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
She did that before.
What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
What?
I fucked up.
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Right on.
I wish there was shit like this back home.
Holy shit, Dulli!
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
What "group"?
Then don't complain.
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
It's good nobody is following us ...
Why?
To show them to the UN, right?
Where were we?
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news?
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
Cause?
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
No.
What did they argue about?
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
She's innocent.
You've been following me?
I have.
Yes.
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
For about one year.
What kind of condition are you referring to?
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
No.
No.
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
Then what happened?
How do you know that?
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
That bastard!
No.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Yes.
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
Yes.
Yes.
This is your house.
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
That's not an answer.
Hi.  It's Frank.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
You're a monster.
I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files.
Yeah.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
This is not relaxing.
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
Is that alright, Frank?
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
You wouldn't like what you'd see. You don't know me anymore.  I don't know me anymore.
It had to get there somehow.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Well, that's a long time.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Michael.
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
What's he saying now?
Grateful!?
I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here.
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
She's changed.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
How long you been married?
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
Want another cigarette?
Why?
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
Feeling better?
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
Why, do you think?
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
What?
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
My mistake. I apologize.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
Oh.
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
Trouble. Why?
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
What?
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
No one's asking you to!
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
Yeah. It could get better.
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
No. Don't do this.
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
Yes. And I've accepted.
What time is it?
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
He yours, sir?
Hey, kid.
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
Where's the gangsta of love?
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
That's some terrible shit.
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
I have to finish this for class.
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
Have you ever been inside?
And what's that?
All the more reason I should be here.
Please.  It's for your own good.
In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
That place is already bad luck.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
And you believe her?
I can't find you.
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
You gotta use your imagination.
Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
You want to get into this now?
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
Caesar!
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!
They were early.
It couldn't have been.
You don't, you can't believe that ...
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
Where is the money?
What did she do to you?
Not on duty, sorry.
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
'63 Chevy.
Do you know him?
Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.
No.
He's a launderer?
Basically.
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
What choice?
These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right.
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
You said he washed the money?
Yeah.
Why?
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
I had a partner and she fucked me.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
Johnnie, what did I say?
Oh, God.
Mickey?  What are you doing here?
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
-- he went inside! --
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
I won't ask again.
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
Yes.
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
Are you Treadstone?
Jason Bourne is dead.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
Right.
...yes -- oui -- uh...
Yes.  Is he there?
...I understand...
Yes.
Excuse me?
I need a ride.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
Get the fuck away from my car.
You have blood on your pants.
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
Four-fifty.  That's the address...
Looks familiar?
So this is it, right?
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
He's dead isn't he?
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
-- we'll explain it --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
Nykwana Wombosi. 
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?

What was I thinking, right?
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
What?
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
Er ... Thanks ...
You don't have to sing it.
Her name is Jill.
I'm waiting for my daddy.
Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Sam!
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
What is it?
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Out of kindness.
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
You're the only person I can trust.
Say it was a mistake.
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
How do you think I feel? You shit!
If you say so.
You think these are tits don't you?
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Why not?
It does doesn't it?
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
Suit me?
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Well, terrorists of course.
Will you please turn back.
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
A cheque.
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option.
Here. What do I do next?
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
Sod it, it's broken!
You haven't switched it on.
Hey - that's my desk!
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
No need, sir
What is it?
Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this!
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
I've never fired anyone in my life.
What if there is no tomorrow?
Pregnant.
Es impossible.
No underwear?
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
You're going to live.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
No way, man.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
Is there any chance?
The first is always the best.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
I think this place stinks.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
You look so different.
You married?
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
Don't seem so bad to me.
I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
You asked me not to come.
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
She's no whore, Marcus.
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
I'll drink to that.
The family know?
You can't believe how much he's improved.
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
It's early for him.
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
They'll just keep calling.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
Shit, shit, shit...
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
What's wrong with it?
I don't like being handled.
London.  That's a promotion!
I don't think so.
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
I'd give anything if that were true.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
Eleven and a half.
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
Yeah -- being a basket case.
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
Really?
Outside?
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
Just a few questions?
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Almost immediately.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
And Bobbie says...
It's Aaron.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Ernie, they're calling from work.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
How's it going?
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Who?
At least kiss me when you do that.
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
What?
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
Why?
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
This is very awkward.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day.  Okay, I'll go first.  I haven't...
Don't you work here?
Not even a little bit?
A girl with a body like mine?
What!
Whaddya mean?
More champagne, your majesty?
Are you ready?
Goodbye.
No! I want to talk about it now!
Why not?!
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Here you go, enjoy.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Don't ask.
It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Where'd ya buy that?
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
Go home.
Well...why murdered man?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
No...look I'm busy...
Hello, Walter.
Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
You're like an undercover guy!
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Are you done with these?
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Maxwell.
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
Hello Mayolia.
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
Gee.  Thanks.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
Oh, OK.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
I was just straightening up the place.
What's wrong with you!?!
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
Well, um... litter?
It's coffee.
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
Yes.
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
It's the news, Buffy.
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
I thought we were meeting here.
Not exactly.
Where are you gonna go?
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
It is a pretty crucial subject.
Where?
I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
Why?
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
Cramps?
What?
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Who we gonna beat?
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
Come one, that was so weird.
I was just scared is all.
Thanks.
So very much.
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
Environment.  That's cool with me.
Except for Prom.
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Nuke?!
Get over here.
--but you're father's in there!
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
I got lured.
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Yep.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
I don't know if I'd go that far.
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
What?
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
Ninety-three miles an hour.
God bless you.
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
If you believe in Voodoo.
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Well, I held it like an egg.
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
It's time you started working on your interviews.
Boring.
What's wrong?
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
Take the first shot at me.
She's playing with my mind.
We'll pray anyway.
Where's Ebby?
Little high.
The organization wants to make a change...now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...
Looking for Crash Davis.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
But what happens when they do find out?
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
...been right, but who knows?
Wait, hold on a second.
Okay.
She's not here, Sam.
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
Amy! Amy, open the door!
Ohh!
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
No, no it's okay.
...very difficult to get in.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
My wife?
Listen, I would -
Please...
Okay?
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
...hundred yards further down the road.
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
You never - ?
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
Ginger called me.
How'd you know I was here?
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
Okay. You come by the house?
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
No, Ace.
Ace, listen to me.
We need this guy.
We can't get rid of him?
This woman's an institution.
Sam, we got a problem.
She took care of the dealers...
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
Why're you crying?
Right?
Uh-huh.
Oh, it's so soft.
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
What do you mean?
...under?
So, what'd ya do with it?
He needed some clothes.
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
You're lower than a dog!
I threw it away.
You threw it away?
I had a... salad.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Get - get up!
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
That's amazing.
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
Okay, I'll -
Well...
All right, I will, I will.
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
A record of the arrests...
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
No.
No, Sir.
Well, I... I never tried.
What?
Is this yours? Your pen?
Yeah.
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
Hey.
Can I go in?
And here. Here.
Here we go!
Is that what you did?
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
We're waiting on Carmine.
He's gone?
Carmine left?
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
What?
I'll take care of it, Remo.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
I'll be right out.
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Hi, how are you?
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
I don't - 
Yeah.
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
No, he's not.
Yes, you are.
A sponsor.
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
Get the fuck out of here.
Yes.
Well, how 'bout that?
Okay?
I'm always here for you.
Promise?
...all the luck in the world.
Okay, then.
Lester - he called you here.
He called you right here.
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
Get up.
Get up.
Stacy. 
It's up to you.
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
He's here.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
They'll do it.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
Oh, sorry -
There's a lot of people here.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
Guilty. I am.
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
How heroic of you...
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
Winning.
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Car wash, Captain?
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
What did--?
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend...
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
Okay, deal.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
Have you got to tell her your life story?
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
What's this?
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
You never miss a trick.
If you know that just back off.
And stop with the directions.
Do I know you?
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
Oh man.  These people mean business.
Please.
I'm with two friends now.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
Our house always needs touching up.
Pictures.
Lenore, I'm here.  I'm getting out.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  Tufts, you know.  It still hasn't grown fully in.  The other one is from the islands.  Braided hair -- very dark.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Can you walk?
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
Why can't it be her?
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
L.A.P.D.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
What's that supposed to me?
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
You're the man with the gun.
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
Where do we meet?
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
I still don't see you.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
You should've done all this before.
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
I suppose you're in your taxi?
I can see the benefit in that.
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
So let's call this the usual.
Then why doesn't she?
Ask him.
Hi.
Did I?
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
If I was her I'd consider that an insult.
Not in my experience.
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
Everybody wants something.
He wants me to perform for him.
You know.
You on the game?
You want me to ask you in, right?
Why?
Yes, please.
What'll it be?
You want to know how I kissed him?
Are you jealous of him?
Do you miss him?
But you can t stay, you know that?
He did sometimes.
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
You think that's wise?
How?
So they do know.
Happy now?
Not at all, honey.
I'm not sure.
What?
Don't call me that --
For me.
I had to go to work!
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
You killed my Jody?
I like you, DIl
Love you, Dil.
What would you do for me?
And you'll never leave me?
Promise?
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --
Stop it, Dil --
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
That's wise, Tommy.
Need to go across the water.
Leave me alone, Jude.
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Give him a cup of tea.
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
So he knows your name?
So it was you all the time.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Thank God for that.
How is it a farce?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
She'd be anyone's type.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
You make a nice couple.
She's a friend of mine
Shouldn't take it personally.
Best game in the world.
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Oh, yeah.
We don't look on it like that.
Don't think that way.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
Yeah?
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
What you say, faster?
You didn't?
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
No -- I guess not.
When you come on, you really come on.
It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
Can you remember anything at all?
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
Reggie -- stop!
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
You mean spies and things like that?
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Ours.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Were you followed?
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
Café.
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
That's the spirit.
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Bartholomew?
What's your first name today?
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
Keep going.
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
I met a man with sharp nails.
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
Whitefoot, of course.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Cutting it out.
They've got Jean-Louis!
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
Maybe.
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
In money.
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
And if it is?
Meaning what?
Tell me what?
I don't know anything.
Leave me alone -- !
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
Is that all? Can I go now?
Of course it is.
Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?
How's that?
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Oh. I guess.
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Are you in the book?
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
I don't think I follow you.
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
What?
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
But what?
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
How can you tell?
Who is it from?
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
Not my imports.
No.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
Ok.
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
Hello?
You know where I can find her?
St. Michael's.
No, you couldn't.
Really?
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Your brother told us.
I'm sure you should have failed.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
Me? Why me?
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
You eventually have to talk to him.
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
You heard about that?
No.
Why?
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
What?
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
My dad's down there!
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
You can ask me anything.
What?
How could you?
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
Yes?
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
You're being unfair.
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
 Oh, shit.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Since today.  New policy.
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
Oh.
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
I need your help.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
...-er.
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
...doing?!
That dog was mean before I met him.
 Excuse me...
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
Borrowed.
Shut up.
Doesn't work.
Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
 Nice job back there.
...gun?!
Kiss my ass!
And I'm a peaceful man, and...



 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
Oh, shit.
Left, left, left!
I know the likeli-...
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
...wanna give it a try!
Come on, old...

You okay?
Gee, you think so?
Holy--!
Shut up!
Hey!

 Go on.
Okay.
These'll keep it cold.
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
Okay.  Okay.
...did you?
You're fucked, man.
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
How wonderful for you.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
...deal with this asshole.
A-And you  owe me...
 

They're takin' off.
Huh?
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
Hey, hey, hey.
Put your hand in my pants.
Reach into my pocket.
Oh.
Yeah.

You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
What?
Sometimes the prey bites back.
Forty-five seven!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
Forty-nine point four.

 Vitelli! Vitelli!
Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
 There's gotta be...

...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
That's bullshit.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.

This country trained me to kill...
I did what I could for you...
...take my sorry old truck.
...here.   Mason... 
All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
...including the permanently extreme.

Whoo-hoo! 
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
Now listen to me.
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
All right.  After they put you away...
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.

Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.

Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  Fur-...
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
I wanna patch in from...
...screwup?
...scientists.
Yeah?
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.

I would've in another life.
...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
There's something else too.
It's after five...
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
Thanks. 
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
What the hell are you talkin' about...
One of our units is pursuing a suspect up the thirty-...
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
 No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... 
He's brains without ambition...
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
Where are you now...
Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!
I said let me see your hands now!
The usual.  Doc.


Gimme this god-...
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
Take it easy, Jake.
'Course you do, Jake.
That's right.
It doesn't hurt.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
None.
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
Yes, his girlfriend.
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
What are you talking about?
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Sure, as soon as we eat.
You sure this is okay?
Jake, listen.
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
Where did you get this material?
I heard it was an accident.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
Not that Mulwray?
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
Mrs. Mulwray?
What do you mean?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
No. I went riding rather early.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Did you have affairs?
I can't tell you.
For very long?
Yes... why?
You sure shout that?
Of course I'm sure.
No.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
As little as possible.
The Albacore Club.
She's not tied up!
I am not!
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
Did you get some sleep?
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
What did you do that for?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
Katherine.
I said I want the truth.
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
Walsh here?
Sophie.
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
The obituary column?
He never even kids about it.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
Only when I breathe.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
I said, the northwest valley.
Yes...
Si.
...Yes of course.
Yeah.
He was expecting you?
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
He did or he didn't?
So he says you sent them?
Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid.  And why are you telling fibs?  We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre...  How much did you have?
Fifty lire... 
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
No...
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
So what'd they say?
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic! 
I don't remember him any more—Ma, where's Russia?
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
So what's that got to do with it?
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
Let's hope they like it there.
Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
You don't really think so?
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
Yes, very!  Naturally.
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!
Do you, Mr. Leland?
What's happened?
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures.
That's Leland, isn't it?
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
Ow!
What's the matter with you?
You've got some on your face.
Oh!
Is that what you want to do?
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan.  Whatever I do -  I do - because I love you.
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
Yes, sir. 
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
Charlie -
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
All right.
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
I know you will.
What check?
Mr. Leland, you were -
Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
That must have been love.
Sure.
Thompson!
That's the whole works, right up to date.
I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
You're shittin' me.
Unnhh!
Yeah, but not in here.
She said not to come home until graduation.
Can I watch?
He was?
I was here the whole time.
Just now.
You're just going to lock the store like that?
Very dramatic, I thought.
It's not what you think.
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
There's more, isn't there?
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
You mean, on a date?
Sang.
He's your fiancé.
So what are you saying?
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
Yeah.
I can pass!
Well, he missed!
So?
Shit!
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
Why are the shutters closed?
Why?
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
You win.
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
Basically.
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
Perfect dozen.
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
Nudie booth?
Which ones?
No.
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
What?
See? There you go again.
How? When?
Number six.
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
Broke his neck.
That's embarrassing?
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
Why should I loan you my car?
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
Please, get the hell out of here.
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Because I'm happy.
This is my way of spitting water at life.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
It's the same thing with Veronica.
Leave me alone.
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
Why do you say that?
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
Do you work tomorrow?
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Get the fuck outta here already.
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
Oh for God's sake!
Did you say Caitlin Bree?
What? When? When did all this shit happen?
One seventy-nine.
He died in the bathroom.
You used to go out with her?
She's my girlfriend.
Meaning?
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
No, he got hit by a bus.
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
What were you doing up so late?
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Typically male point of view.
How many what?
All right. Name it.
What do you mean?
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Something like thirty-six.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
What is it?
You couldn't get these shutters open?
A couple...?
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
Scumbag. What are you doing?
What did he say?
Is he staying here?
To an Asian design major.
Really?
Sure. How about the beach?
And... he told you all of this?
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
Surprise me.
A monkey?
It can't fly in this weather.
Bags?
Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.
Jessie!  Are you alright?
I love you, too.
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
That's it, you look like a professional.
Help me!  I don't want to die!
That's a virtue isn't it?
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
A flare up...
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
Remember the first time we came up here?
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
Never could save a thing.
You said there was a way across.
You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
What the hell are you doing--
I don't trust him.
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
Good evening.
Phoned some friends, sir?
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
Do you feel that way now?
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Where is he now, sir?
Surprise?
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
No, sir.
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Fucking hell...
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
Yeah... Pete the English.
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
D'you think we should do something?
Sixth is faster.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
Bottega.
Just had one.
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
Can't say that I do.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
Twenty five?
Very generous.
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Quite an achievement...
I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
Oh.  Oh, thank God, hey!  Hey, guys, hey, help me out here!
Yeah?  So?
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
You on some kind of work plan?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
I think he's dead.
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
Got it?
Uh, look...why don't you just take the car...
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
How about the thingy next to it?
I didn't throw him, he fell.
Please.  Don't do anything.
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
Collateral damage.
Vincent?
I'm not catching a melody.
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
Don't start.
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...
You had to kill Heller?!
Head towards Union Station.
One more.
You're full of shit.
What happened to you?
As in...? 
Slow down.
Well.  That was brilliant.
They said send you downstairs.
That's love.
I was only going one way.
Mississippi?
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
Do you still ride?
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
Motive?
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
What is it with you and the space program?
You're certifiable.
You okay?
Surprise me.
If my universe had a hub...
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Who are you, Jerry?
Shoot.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Okay, I will.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
How'd you get the picture?
I'm sorry.
I'm a very patient man.
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
You do recognize it then?
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
Tell me about it.
Agent Lowry.
What do you suggest?
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
Dr. Arroway --
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
David --
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
David --
Ellie.
What?
Right.  Well.
What's the status of the decryption effort?
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
And?
No primer.
Ellie.  Pulsar?
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
That isn't the way it works.
I didn't realize I was out.
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
What's that?
What are you talking about?  It's over.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
We could be together again --
But what about your research -- ?
Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
How do you mean?
'My father's house has many mansions.'
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
Why?
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
I can't do this --
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
Yeah.
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Go git it, Luke.
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
What happened? How far did you get?
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
A cold drink? Okay?
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
Luke. Where you goin?
On my own.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
That fool. That damn fool.
Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains.
I'm in.
Kick a buck.
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
No. No chains either.
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
I want to die.
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
You're fired.
Yes.  Without question.
When was that?
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
I never hurt nobody...
Where is it?
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
Who is this?
Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control.
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
For months... last October.
Nothing.
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
Ruben.
Is that it?
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
He was in my apartment!
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
I like women like that!
Is Niccoletti <u>assigned</u> here?
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
So what have we got?
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
Put in the Kevin Costner.
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
That's going well, then.
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it?
You're kidding.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Crash victim?
What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
What kind of place is this?
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
What?
What's up with you?
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
And the party?
Yeah, everything's under control.
What about the engagement party?
What about this one?
I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
I gather he's late as usual.
I haven't had a crush since I was
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
Yeah?
Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
By color.
Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
But you're checking it out.
He asked me to marry him.
Very romantic setting.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
Guess.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
Then it's over.
Just checking.
Do you like it?
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Something like that.
Why'd you tell?
I guess so.
Well then why'd it happen?
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
Forget I asked.
It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
I don't think so.
I think we need to talk about some things.
Especially this last year.
Especially now.
I heard about your friend.
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
You killed her!
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
My number's going to show up on his bill!
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
I assume you want something?
And the other half?
I don't know.
We can't.
Turn on the flashlight.
I thought they came with batteries.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
What room number?
The map said to go left.
Mr. Taylor?
The baseball is mine.
How?
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Where's your master?
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
On guard!
I'm just playing around.
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
You don't seem to understand.
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
Please.
You know about Lo?
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
Let's stop a moment.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
What happened?
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
What does it say?
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
Don't thank me.
My name.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
What's goin' on, Elly?
Do you know what you destroyed?
Another jolly nickname?
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
You'll be alone.
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Excuse me?
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
What do you mean?
Annette, how long have we known each other?
Got a boyfriend back home?
You a lesbo?
It's not really important.
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
You talking to me?
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
Why not?
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
You're naked.
Give it up.
What?
I'm... I'm alright.
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
What are you doing?
Sure. Have a good night.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
Oh please.
Yes it does.
I do not.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
Where are you going?
Good for you.
Hi.
Why are you trying to hurt me?
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
What are the boys like?
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
Okay.
That was cool.
Well do you like him?
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Who is it?
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
No.
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
Just a kiss, right?
I like it better when I'm on top.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
Same time next week?
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
It works a little.
You do?
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Hi, mom.
He told me he loved me and I believed him.
One.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
Interesting.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
What's your plan of attack?
Have you succeeded in your task?
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
And that's why you're losing your bet?
Kind of.
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
Some other time.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
Get out? We had an arrangement.
Didn't you hear what I said?
You will be discreet about this?
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
What song, dear?
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Did you ever make a wish?
Sometimes.
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
She was very pretty.
Irena.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
I'm never unfair.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
Hello, Amy.
What do you want. Amy?
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
But...
You called me by my name.
For as long as you'll let me.
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
Look at my ring.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
Then I'll tell you a story — a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Yes...yes, that's true.
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
Translation: a total geek.
Anything's better than Mark.
It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
Why would they exaggerate?
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
I've been here. What day is it?
Get rid of him!
He's been here all night?
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
What the fuck are we going to do?
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
Peter keeps asking me out.
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
It's a matter of life and death.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
No, she died when I was twelve.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
What's that supposed to mean?
Your breasts feel larger.
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
We can get a warrant if you like.
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
She's just so... pathetic.
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
Madonna's in Penthouse?
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
The park dude was missing an arm.
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
He tried to kill me!
What is this place?
Was that for real down there?
Good evening, sir.
Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
Where are we going?
Go on.
Where do you think this goes?
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
But...  How long has this been happening?
Which one?
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
Yes.
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
Horrible...
I'm sorry.  About before.
What are you doing?
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
Don't say a .
Right and don't embellish.
What the hell is this?
What do you think you're doing?!
Nightmare...
Bob...
Mild stroke?
A condition...
We think so.
I was a senator, you know.
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
Check his kids.
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
What do you mean by that?
So you want to go swimming?
Dave -- I'm working.
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
That'd be great.
Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
No.
Fine.
President vetoes works bill?
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
No.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave.
You bet.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
Anybody would have done it.
Are you hungry?
What?
You really believe that?
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
The Monroe?
We're working on it.
Please....shoot me.
What is it?
Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
Gasparilla?
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
That sounds like a curse to me.
Datura.
How long do we have to watch him?
TONY....TONY....
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
Step up here, Tyler.
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
So don't goddam come!  Please.
I'm in as long as we're careful.
Women swoon!
What is the point?
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Yes sir.
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
Welton Academy, hello?  Yes, he is, just a moment.  Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
Yes... sir.
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
Nuwanda, what is going on?
Stop what?
Chris!
Knox, I don't believe this!
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
Courtyard?
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
A yawp?
LOUDER!
A madman.
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
A sweaty-toothed madman
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Come on boys, don't be shy.
What did the name mean.  Did you only read dead poets.
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  It's just a bunch of people trying to impress Nolan.
What is it?
Nothing.
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
I don't want to read.
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
It's my birthday.
This play?
You the Captain?
It's not going to help us!
Who?
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
Noooo!
Got it?
How do you know that?
Finnegan...
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
What is it man?
Yeah.
Fuel up. Need fuel.
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
She does not!
Couple of weeks... Listen --
You're back.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
No, I --
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
No.
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...
Will you marry me?
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
You seem... disturbed.
You can do it, Sal.
This is horrible!
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
You think about it?
The shot?
I don't think about the shot that much.
Hell no!
Hey, Nick?
Huh?
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
Right.
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
Did you get one?
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
Never one.
You're full of shit!
Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
I want to ask you a few questions.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
What's this?
Hello Wade.
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
Need help?
Yes.
NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.
Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
Yeah.
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
...What are you talking about...?
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
Let's dance together -- Belle.
Who are these people?
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
Never mind. What's your name?
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
Opportunities?
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Not long -- now.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Why -- good morning, Squire.
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
You are not so sure that he'll come.
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Jabez!
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
We must go on home, Jabez.
But I'm glad to be home again --
There is nothing to worry about now.
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
Hard luck -- like me.
Helps sometimes to say it.
What's ailing that dog?
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Let him try it.
Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
Just someone from New Hampshire!
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
What are you going to do?
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
How long?
I...have a request.
Go on.
Oh...Where does he live?
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
John!
Holly Gennero?
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
Is that him?
Yes, I would.
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying another man?  Did I do something to make you do that?  Did I ever turn you down, or anything?  The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places!  And I let myself get fat.
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
They're not after you, they're after me.
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
Hello.  Hello, Leon.
So... that sure is something.
Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
I'm sorry...
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
Denmark?  Sweden?
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?
Right.  See you sometime.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
You alone, or you got confederates?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
I frisk you?
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
Don't fuck with me ...
We're all set at Kennedy.
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
You like me?
I'm sorry.
Would I hire you?
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
Ah, Jesus...
Sal, I'm sorry about this.  But we can get outta this thing.  There's a way outta this.
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?

We'd kill ourselves.
I'm here.
Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!
I am.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Hey, you okay?
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
Maybe...
Doing what?
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
And if you can't deliver them?
Morning.
<i>We gotta bring him in.</i>
She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there!
Yes.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
<i>The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now.</i>
Cunt.
We didn't sign on for this shit.  Fuck! This shit is intense. I need to call my agent.
Where is Domino?
You were good.
Meeka's white blood cell count is dropping fast.
Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.
What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
Make it plain.
The evil eye doesn't work on me.
My name is Eddie.
How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying?
Wake up!
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
C'mon, don't be shy.  Mmm, smells good.  This is ya Love Daddy talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin. Say something, Mookie.
WAKE UP!
Don't worry about it.
Sweet Dick Willie.
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
I would like to get paid now.
Sal, I don't care if you fire me this exact minute, leave my sister alone.
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
C'mon, Sal.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
No.  What are you gonna do?
I work too, but I still make time.
Why you gotta curse?
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
It's 'pose to be cold.
Later for you.
Feels good.
Be a man.
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
You talk to 'em.
Shut up.  The Boss!  Bruuucce!!!!
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
I love you, my brother.
You listening to me?
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
We don't know nuthin' else.
In the new library there.
Hey guys.
Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.
I'm fine.
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
Who's Captain Rob?
Yeah, go-cart accident.
Will not.
Collins is a great man!
These are really cold, huh?
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
You have beautiful eyes.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
Go away, assface.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
I lugged it all over town!
I... found that rock.
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
Ready Lloyd?
Wait, wait!
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
I thought I told you to get lost.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
Okay.
Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
LLOYD, may I see you a minute?
I am strong!
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
God, I've missed you.
You said "aloha" twice.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
Times two.
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
What?
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
Love it!
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
We felt his presence.
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
We have just folded space from Ix...
I can assure you...
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
As the legend says.
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
He knows.
Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
You've worn a stillsuit before?
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Always.
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
What's in the box?
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
What is it?
... Many men have tried.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
Do you want me to get it for you?
I don't understand.
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
Should I call a doctor?
I never said I could ad-lib...
Bela, are you ready?
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
What happened?!
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
H-how'd you know?!
I guessed.
I don't understand.
You got the job?!!
Better than not getting a job?
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
But there's plenty of other parts.
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
I kinda need it now.
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
What other sixty-thousand?
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
Really?!  Well good for you.
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
Mr. Reynolds!
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"!
"Where's the ads"?!  The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri!  You schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
No! I love sex with girls.
What was that?
You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
The sun.
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
Lines around the block.
I don't know.
Ed, you said you were getting permission.
You're <u>sure</u>???
What octopus motor?
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!
Isn't that the same thing?
What if--you're vomiting?
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
Yeah, so... ?
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
Yes!
She doesn't give a shit about him.
This guy.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
Mr. Pekurny.
Mm...  Oh, man...

I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
How's Marcia? She all right?
She could've been a nurse.
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
Mom?
Who?
But Al is your husband now!
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
No.
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
What are you doing?
What does this mean?
I hear the dog really liked him.
Cream rinse?
What do you want?!
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
Really?
Oh God, this is so weird.
What are you doing?
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
The what?
Kinda'.
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.
Thumbsucker!
What?
You would do this? You would actually --
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
Ray --
Hi.
You watching the ballgame?
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
Why me?
You brought the girl!
Look, we gotta talk.
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
I was in jail.
-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Ed?
We don't have foibles.
Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
Well, good luck there, Tracy
I guess you know why you're here
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Yeah.
Yes?
What a surprise.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Exactly when?
Which door?
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
Should we get a what?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Hey Yeah?
I was lonely.  You took advantage
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
But other people can see them too.
For what?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
Do you enjoy it?
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
Do you like being a cop, Bud?
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Captain, what do you want?
You know him?
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
Stens?  Was it Stens?
Was it... a rat?
What happened?
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
Bud...
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
What little studio?
What do you want, <u>officer</u>?
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
Whose shoe?
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
The youngest applicant by eight years.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
No.
<u>No</u>.
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
Listen, I think I made a mistake, too.
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
I'm curious about you.
How was I?
Why not?
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Officer White?
Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
Something like that.
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
I just gave him my card.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
What if--
How do you know so much?
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
Looks like Detroit.
Yeah.
What's going on?
You sure?
What about newspapers and magazines?
What if--
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
Feeling lucky?
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
Hi, Mr. Dean.
That's fine.
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
How 'bout Christian Dior?
<u>What's</u> your point.
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
The robbery.
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
About what?
Somebody took my blender.
Did he give you anything?
No.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
For your wife?
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
Robert--
It's not real...  That's not me.
Stacy--
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
I know, but listen--
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
Oh.
How's the trout?
It is fish.
Do you like fish?
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
Why would I--
Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
You're not.
Eat your fish.
Good. You're just what I need right now.
You being audited?
For the last four years.
Bullshit.
I'm gonna fix it.
You're a moron, you know that?
We believe he did.
God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean. 'Cause you're a labor lawyer.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
I don't under--
Why?
Sure, go ahead.
Dad!
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
Yes.
They're framing me.
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
Am I to understand--
Hiding something?
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
You're kidding me.
No sir.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
As the wife of one of our party.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
You should come into the shelter.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Don't.
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
It's a folk song.
It's beautiful.  What's it about?
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
Which we've overflown twice.
No.
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
What if I told you he did this to me?
Hello.
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
Why do you think?  About my staying?
Lady H said she thought you might be -
Aren't you?
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
What?
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
That's a different dress.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
Arguing about books.
There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
No. But he hands them over.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
Kip… I -
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
Pardon me?
You don't call, you don't write.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
How close?
Where are you at least?
Gin? Where the hell are you?
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
You can't.
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
We're doing this together. We're partners.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
Terrified. Still am.
Camera in the--
One, two, three...
STOP! You're making...mistake.
The big job.
What?
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
You can't be serious.
Can't be too careful.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
They drive so recklessly there.
Relax, don't jam it...
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
Always in a rush.
Which is--
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
Because I never assume anything.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
Tonight your league night?
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
See you.
Probably not.
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
Whoa.  Remind me.
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
Jesus.
How does someone get meningitis?
You're a lawyer?
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
Excuse me?
Oh, yeah?
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
What medical records?
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
I don't get why they'd do that.
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
I like this case.
Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
Is that what you want?
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
Counts?
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
So why would PG&E offer it?
You see your office?
The extortion, the threats ...
Corey.
I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
You want my number?
You got a little girl?
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
You're not nothing, Erin.
I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
Lock the door.
Thinking.
What's that?
More than you need me.
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.
I'm embarrassed.
That's okay.  I understand.
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
Uh-huh?
He can do it.
Will he finish what he begins?
You must survive, Luke.
Barks at his master.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
You know the Jedi Master?
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
What are you so grouchy about?
That was no earthquake.
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
Never heard of that system.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
Can you trust him?
You look great.
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
This ought to be good.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
The deflector shields are gone.
I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
A tremor!
Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
No!
I'll die first.
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
And we can watch ...
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
They look pretty docile.
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
His reactor's starting to overheat.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
Ooww!
Cuervo...?
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
Where's Plissken?
Don't lie to me.
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
So what does this thing do?
Plissken...?
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Got a smoke?
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
Where are they going?
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Me too?
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Run, Snake...They're coming.
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
I'm looking for somebody.
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men--
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.
They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
Perceval, you have returned!
He can be no other.
Yes.
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
It didn't hurt too much, did it?
No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week.
I'm going.
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
I'm sorry.
Hi
Didn't who tell me?
Groceries maybe? A package?
Would you like some more coffee?
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
Oh, she'd love it.
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
Lies?
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
Well, not while we're in Washington.
Captain Howdy.
He's nice.
Regan, why are you reading that?
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
Yeah
Well you know it's okay.
St. Mike's.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
It would bring us together.
Ego te abslovo.
No.
No.
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen.
And let my cry come unto thee.
Amen.
Her heart.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
MERRIN!!!!!!!
Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime!
Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
Do you have an appointment?
You're not going to drive!
Little slow tonight.
What're you saying, Charlie?
What's wrong with them?
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
How will he eat?
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
Piano.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
How's the birthday girl?
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
When they coming in?
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
Fuck him.
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
You gotta go.
It's not family.  It's business.
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
No.
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
Talk.
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
Get out of here!
You're a fucking alarm clock.
You recognized me.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
Good idea.
You leaving that on?
All night?
Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
Really.
What the hell are these?
Huh?
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
What?
Stay off it.
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
Jack!
Looks like these got a few years on them.
How're your hands?
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Charlie called.
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
Sick?  How sick?
So she's got a few sniffles.
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
Actually, that's my stage name.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
This is where the auditions were.
You're an hour and a half late.
My watch is broken, too.
We ran long.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
What's wrong with it?
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
Shoes?
They're nines.
Oh, thanks.
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
Virgins?
Smells like tuna number two to me.
What's with you two?
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.
Gotta go.
How come?
Brought it.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
Is that the way it is?
Pretty much.
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
So why's he do it?
Can't sleep?
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
How do you do it? Every night?
Nothing.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
Nina?
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
Must've been a cheap date.
History.
Nervous?
You're kidding.
Hi.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
How do you know?
Oh?
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Fine.  You?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
How old is he?
Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
One last time.  It's important ...
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
Which ear was it?
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
Kim?
Castor's escaped!
What happened?
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
I'm just having some fun.
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
What do you know about it?
What's on your mind?
I'll deal with her later.
Back then -- who wasn't?
Oh, and Oxxford called...
You?  Married?
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Don’t you think that’s a little gimmicky?
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  It’s throwin’ everybody off.  What do you think?
C’mon, Evelyn Thompson’s got no class.  She doesn’t marry Dr. Steve, the woman’s living in a trailer.
It’s me, Jack...
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
No.
How'd you know my name was Jack?
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
It’s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
Why not?
What’s this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
What're you talkin' about?
What!?  Look at the ticket...!
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Like the dress...?
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
Why not?
Shouldn’t we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
Really.
The trek out to the hospital every day didn’t help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
Worse, you mean...
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
I could stay here forever...
Think bigger.
You’re talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
This is New York City, it’s like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours aren’t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
I’m moving to Paris...it was right here...  It’s a box marked “Jack.”  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
...we’re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
That’s easy. You’ve seen my car.
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
I mean...
What the --!
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
It's about to be a broken face.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Ben?
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
But all these people...
And where do we think we're going?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Ben's still out there --
Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --
But I'm not done with the machine --
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
I think it was a little more complicated than --
Of course.  Of course.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
You <u>were</u>?
What are you doing?
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Please don't make this personal --
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don.
The less time, the better.
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
-- and why we need you.
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
We must!
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
Shouldn't you answer that?
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
But that isn't possible.
Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
What's that?
Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
That line was tampered with...
Looks like quite a way to go...
May I?
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
Drop that fucking money!
What's this, sir?
I don't think so. It's nice.
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know.
She started shrieking, you know.
...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -
No, that's not it, Jerry.
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
Oh, yah, I know that!
How ya doin'?
Uh-huh.
Just a general way.
Yah.
Uh-huh.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
Yah, right -
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
Sir? Right now?
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
Okay.
Where're you going?
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
I know it's a lot.
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
Well, they -
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Call 'em up.
Yah.
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Yah.
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
Yah, that's a good one.
Well, how the heck are ya?
...This is a nice place.
I'm sorry, Mike.
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Yah, is this Marge?
His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some "red-flags" to cover.
Why are you doing this?
I'll take the parasites.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
So you're staying in tonight?
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
What are you talking about?
I don't know ...
No... no problem.
Uh ... nah.
Is this a trick?
What?
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
How have you been?
Is this a test, sir?
This is how I met --
Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
Don't I?
I don't follow...
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
How do you feel?
Strange.
But a good strange.
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
What car?
What?
"I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in first person.  "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."  There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."
A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
Hemingway.  You?
Hey... don't knock librarians.
What?
Huh?
Look at your hand.
I asked you what you studied.
I feel sick.
What are you doing?!
This conversation...
... is over.
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
Why did you do that?
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
Is this really news to you?
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
You took me to the house.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
...stop me?
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
Defuse the bomb, please.
What the fuck -- ?
Paraffin.
Do something for me.
Appreciate something.
Look at me...
You told me you'd say that.
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
His name is Robert Paulson!
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
I... I don't know...
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
Are you Jorge Cruz?
We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
I tried calling last night but your father --
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
Kalarjian?
Want me to drive?
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.
I mean it.  Take care of it.
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight?  I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
Thirty-nine.
No.
4:25.
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?
Fag.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
Knock it off!
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Ninety.
Show me how it operates.
Yeah.  Why not?
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
What's she saying?
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
I'm getting him out.
You comin'?
How do we get upriver?
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
Christ.  How'd you get here?
I do?
Yes you can.
John.  My name is John.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
Where?
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
What?
I know.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Hello, John.
Those men are all dead.
We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
No really..I can't.
Yep! Right on it!
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
I was attacked.
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
What does that mean?
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
I wanna go...Just let me go...
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
So how do we do this?
Free?
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
I need a drink.
Where -- ?
The Little People?
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
Parry... I'm Jack.
But I gave it to you!
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
SAW WHO!!?
It's such a great song.
Who are you talking to Jack?
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
Holdin' my penis...
In a bar called Hellfire.
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
No, I...
Well, id'n that nice.
Serveza yourself!
You can sing the song.
Who said I was depressed?
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
Sure...
Rayette.
No.
Well...
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
You always do this to me.
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Like what?
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
Where is she, anyway?
I guess you fell in the water.
Yes, intentionally.
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
Oh. You have to tell me that.
Robert, do you mind?
What?
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Steam.
Miss Dupea.
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
Do you have a name?
What?
Remember me, from the pool?
Nothin'.
So what's her name?
I kissed those girls.
So what girls are over there?
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
She lives near Eddie?
A bad attitude.
I think he's 18 or 17.
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
So what do you want with her anyway?
Yeah.
Maybe tonight?
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Fletch, this is dumb.
You're lucky.
Fletch.
What the hell are you doing here?
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
Funny old bird.
There is?
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
I think I’d rather have drugs.
Jesus.
Thought so. What for?
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Hi Gummy. How’s the eye?
They bust you every week.
Sure you did.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
Sure, all drifters do.
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
Yeah.
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
Cute young thing, too.
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
Why do you keep doing this?
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
Why'd you let me in?
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
What is this?
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
You want I set up?
Your call is come through.
The door was unlocked.
No wonder.
I commend him on his choice.
Where is she?
Fletch.
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
So let's go! We run the pictures.
I'd say charcoal.
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
What about finding the source?
How could you call him?
You were going to can me, right?
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
But I ain't got you...
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Oh... I have some questions.
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
Contacts.
Hello, Ford...
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
Why are all these people after me?
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
My axe!
This is boring, guys.
This way...
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
Pretty smooth, huh?
Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
Are you okay?
Who cares?  I got a case.
Did he just say what I think he said?
You need it.
'Booty Time.'
I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Shock.
It doesn't have to be like this?
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
That's funny, you're cute.
How nice.
What's my name?
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
Doesn't register.
Well try, okay?
What?
It has to be by the end of this week.
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Comment va-t-elle?
Il fallait le faire.
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
You want some eggs.
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
Suspicion of what?
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
Why not?
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
You're shitting me!
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
I'm serious.
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
Hey, bud.
No.  This isn't what you think.
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
29 years...?
What the hell...
I'm thirty-five years old.
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
Yeah, it's me.
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
What do I tell them?
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
He took your wallet?
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
Sull!  What the hell!
Gordo?
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
Which means he probably knew her.
He ain't our guy, John.
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
No more... I can't!
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
What's this?
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
Is that so bad?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
What d'ya got in there?
In that little thing?
What?
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
I thought Jason was only a legend?
It's all over.
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
Nancy.
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
It was a community service.
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
What are you going to do?
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
Jason's here in New York.
What are you doing in here?
You have no right...
I don't think that's such a safe idea
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
It's not that simple.
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
Crosstown.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Tonight. What's tonight?
He carries a gun.
We're making too much of this.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
Had to be him.
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
Does it feel comfortable?
I hear Alan's sick.
You know about Adele.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
The Red Sox
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
Except I won't have a father anymore.
What's sexy?
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Two-all after six.
Opening night, Lillian.
That's very lovely actually.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
What's it like to shoot somebody?
Who is it?
It's me. Nicky.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
You know the answer to that.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
Sidney remains optimistic.
Sidney.
Yes.
And he has finer moments now and then.
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
The fact is, I have to get going.
Is it true?
Do you think he can do it?
Someone waiting for you?
Oww!
Please! You're being foolish!
Just an admirer...
No violence, please.
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
You're an ambitious man.
Hm.  Is it?
A great deal.
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
It's split the Government.
Will you have a glass of sherry?
Assuming we are in agreement?
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
No?  What's keeping you?
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
A man's dead, Detective.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
Surely you know what you have.
Twelve have a mission within the week.
Good to see you're feeling better.
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
We can't stay here.
What makes them think that?
In a corridor.
Is that all?
If you say so.  The stripe.
Again?
Where are you taking her?
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
What do you think?
Vincent...Vincent...
He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
I was at home.
It was a mercy-killing after all.
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
Come on.
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
What are you doing?
I can't do this.
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
The doctor will give you something.
I get my own help.
What about them?
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
And you got him...
That's your problem.
Where do you want to go?
Where did you get them developed?
Half a million.
What do you want for dinner?
You go out much?
Why?
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
Why didn't you tell me?
Yeah.
He must have.
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
We're going to make it.
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
We got this far.
Can we make it?
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
How long before this car's hot?
What now?
No, I'm not.
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
You were with him?
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Okay. How many bank exits?
Wire pull over?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
What's the damage?
I've got to stop.
What did you do?  Albert?
Nothing. What could I do?
What did he say?
What do you want?
What happened to this car?
What's it got to do with you?
This is my brother's car.
Yes.
Why?
Why?
Christ, what...
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
No, don't Jack, don't.
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Yes.
Who?
Sid Fletcher.
While he was here. You went about together?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
Nasty.
Entertaining.
Was it Albert?
Who set it up?  Eric?
Yeah.
I left last year.
You coming to South America?
I mean, what for?
Why would it?
Don't know.
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
You sod.
What's that supposed to mean?
What you going to do?
It would be. If they were still living.
Meaning what?
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
Oh, you've been watching television.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
Nasty way to go.
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
You ever get 'em?
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
Some contest board...
I...
...that's right...
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
Yes.
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
Huh.
No.
You...
...you're absolutely right.
They have...
When they...
What?
What?
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
Did you talk to Graff?
A job with Graff.
He'd give me a job.
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
Is that what I just said?
You need money?  Is that the...
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
Why don't you think so?
Yes.
Will you excuse...
I don't know, George, why?
The leads come in, I'll let...
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
Could I...
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
...then...
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
And what if you don't close.
Not lately you can't...
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
Now?  Now?
You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
No.
Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. "Mur, this new kid burns my ass." "Shelly, he's out." You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once...
You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?
What happened?
The leads are coming.
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
Mmm.
Excuse me...
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
You robbed the office.
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
Was it?
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?
I got 'em in the kitchen.  I'm eating her crumb cake.
Eight units?
They took the phones...
How was it...?
From the store.
Fuck her...
"Always be closing..."
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
Did I...?
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
I've got to talk to you.
It's funny, you know, you get a picture of the Corporation-Type Company Man, all business...this man, no.  We'll go out to his home sometime.  Let's see.  Tomorrow.  No.  Tomorrow, I'm in L.A....Monday...I'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go?
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
If we wait till Mon...
And when was that check cashed?
Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.
What does that mean?
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
I...
What...?  Say the words.
What?  What?  What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.
Why not?
Have a good trip.
Did they...
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get this, from the morgue?
I know.  How long will you be gone?
Will you take me?
You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year.  You're much taller than me.
That's right.
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
 What?  You read it in the papers?
What took so long?
Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
I got surprises for everybody!
Connie.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
I don't want to stay here...
No, Dad.
He is weak.
Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little.  Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
I've always taken care of you.
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
Goddamn it, where were you?
Me too, Tom?
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
If you need anything, just...
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
Go on, tell me.
Was it a boy or a girl?
Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
What's up?
The room has a bug in it.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
Do you gamble?
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
Goodbye, Michael.
Are you Klingman?
You said you were Klingman.
Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
Yes.
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you.  How beautifully we've done it, step by step.  Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government.  Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible.
This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
I deny his every charge.
Says who?
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
I want you to help me take my revenge.
I want you to settle on their terms.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Are we going to eat or what?
What if I say shove it?
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
Yes.
Fuck you.
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
I'm not married.
Of course.  I am married still.
What have you done with him?
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
I stink to high heaven right now.
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
No.  I'm fine.
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
No.
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --
You first.
Everybody has stories to tell.
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
Not fear.  More like disgust.
You're the one who started it.
Just go.  Please.  Why don't you go?
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
I suppose you'd like the top down.
David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
Are you enjoying yourself?
A very lucky thing indeed.
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you.
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
You coming, Boone?
Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.
I didn't ask George to invite you.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
Who was that at the door?
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.  This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
Quite.
Sit?
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
I'm not interested --
What do you mean -- ?
How is he?
Let them go --
Kip.
I know you.
What's this -- ?
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
The other day....
You seem a little hinked-up ...
I guess ...
You guys have any skills at all?
What color?
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
Forget that ...
There's no one left ...
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
What does that mean -- ?
You, too, Ma...
He's in some trouble ...
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
Any more ...
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
Kip -- ?
You all right -- ?
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
Yeah -
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
"Shadow games?"
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
You okay -- ?
I've missed you, man ...
I know ...
You know of one -- ?
What's with the look?
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
Very good...
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
Unlock your button ...
The alarms go off ...
Now... I'm in ...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
Hear you roar ...
What about The Club ... ?
This time it's for real?
What's that?
Are you considering a comeback tour?
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
I warned you a million times.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
Jezuz Christ!
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
What?
Give'm a drink.
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
It's a fait accompli?
Where'd you find such creeps?
I gotta go home.
Stay there.
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
I got dry cleaning.
I don't want them left back.
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan?
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
Who'd you call?
Why not?
How's the woman?
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
You and Morgan throw?
Oh, right.
You caught that, huh?
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
Some other guy?
Why don't you beat off at your house?
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
Somethin's in my room.
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
No students work for me.
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
Hey fuck you.
Of course.
--that?--
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
Thank you.
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
So who won the bet?
I didn't see you at the reunion.
They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Tom.
You're here quite a bit, then.
You moved?
Jobs doing what?
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
Hold on!
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
--I don't have any anger at you--
Do you know when you'll be back?
About thirty million to one.
There is somebody...
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
I might understand that.
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
I did.
Crayons?
This is a real piece of shit.
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
Watch your mouth.
Why thank you.
I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it.
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
When did you know she was the one?
Do you have a soul-mate?
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
I really don't 'date' that much.
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
Not far from here, South Boston.
Yeah.
How many?
Want me to take a look?
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
I want you to come with me.
What am I scared of?
At least you have a mother.
Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
Twenty days work, oh boy!
How 'bout you?
But ain't no reason--
Naw. They paroled me.
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
Any gas?
I guess that's what he looked like.
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Can all of you work?
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
They're all gone--or dead.
I ain't gonna run.
You're right!
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
I didn't mean nothing.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
Sometimes they do.
Don't taste bad.
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Ma, you sick?
When?
How's it feel, Tommy?
They killed Casy first.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 
But who done it?
Well?
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
She's jus' wore out, that's all.
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Whatsa matter?
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
Please don't.
What's this?
Now you done it! You busted it!
You don't...
You're so funny...
Bob...
What am I gonna do?
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
So you eat-- read it everyday?
I'm a professional killer.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
Flowers. That's funny.
Do you want to get a drink first?
Shoulda brought my gun.
I was leaving.
I'm staying here.
You don't understand...
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
No deal.
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
There you go. I left it blank.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
Never enough.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
To shoot you. Correct.
Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
Why not?
Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
Enjoy the day.
Shit.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Feel good?
Yeah.
How long did you live here with your wife?
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
I brought it to you in the hospital.
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Did he tell you that?
Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
Who's there?
What about Grace?
I'm sorry.
Doing what?
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
I miss you, Annie.
About what?
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
Take your time.
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
Oh, I don't know...
I'll help you with the coffee.
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
I'd love to go there one time...
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
When you figure on branding?
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
I don't believe it.
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
Don't you go to school?
Would you let me ride your horse?
Of course I have.
Can you drive?
Are you afraid of anything?
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
"... and I said that"...
Jude, you okay?
Where did you learn all this stuff?
What do you mean?
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
Oh yeah? What's that?
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
Shh!
Right.
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Damn!
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!
I'm taking over a TV network.
Mm-hmm.
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
Blow me.
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
That's a nice score for a girl.
What the hell is going on?
It has a killer refresh rate.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Yeah.
Kate, listen.
Shit!!
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
What?
It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
Never fear. I is here.
Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
Any questions?
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
So?
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
What?
So?
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
We've been better.
You think she stands a chance?
Brady!
Brady!
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
How do you know their not?
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
Night Doc.
Who you calling?
Kido. It's four in the morning.
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
I don't want to.
Hi.
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
You don't believe that do you?
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
Call me.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Right here, Ben.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
This is starting to spook me.
Where's that Deputy?
Sort of.
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
Hi, Dad. What happened?
Why didn't you wait for me?
Well, are we still on for tonight?
He was standing right here.
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
You locked yourself in.
Just answer the damn phone.
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
Exactly what do you need?
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
There WAS.
What did he look like?
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
Laurie, you come with us...
Of course not.
If you say so.
I love that.  That's my type.
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
Right.
Yeah.
It's really sad.
And it ruins everything else.
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
When did you first notice this?
Hi, Dusty.
You--  Standards and Practices?
Ed Smythe, yes.
Hi.
Ohhhh!
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
No!  No...
No?
No, I don't think so.
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Page a hundred and twelve.
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
Elliot!
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
Poor Hannah.
I can't say anything!
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
Mm-hm?
Great idea.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
It's so late.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
How do you know?
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
I'm sorry.
Hello?
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
It was on your shirt!
Yeah...but you're not dying!
Yeah.  What?
Yes, please.
...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
Ohh!
Well, what about artificial insemination?
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
Hey!
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
You found all this, all this out on one date?
Singing?
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
You're too demanding.
You're crazy!  That's not true.
Hey, what's the matter?
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Yes, you do recall, right?
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
Good.  How are you?
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
Well, I hope you've changed.
I'm okay.
Yeah.
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
Oh, wow!
Oh, who cares?
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Hi.
...you don't have to think.
Some museum director disappeared.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
We could skip the Gavotte.
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do."  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
...they did it for a lark.
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
Evelda Drumgo.
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
Then you tell me, then.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
How you doin?
M'I gonna see you tonight?
Then I'm doing fine.
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
I like Popcorn...
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
Why?
I don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these Warriors, ¥our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver <u>this</u>... Getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>. 
Waal...
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
I've left my <u>program</u>...
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
We got KittyKat...
Yes.... yes...
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
Why should <u>you</u> care?
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
...and that is what you need to expand.
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
Then we cannot go.
What shape is the scar?
...what a lovely perfume.
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
Then tell me.
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
For approval.
Yes.
But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"-- 
That's right.
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
...yes...?
For the <u>worst</u> hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
...sir...?
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
Talia, don't go!
Mine!
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
Yeah. And?
Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we should discuss--
I just never thought of you in that...
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
Yeah. I guess I do.
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
So, are you a cheerleader?
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
Because you're an idiot.
Something like that. Will you do it?
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
There are no stupid questions.
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
S'okay....
Killing her won't solve anything.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
Chick-en.
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
You can be so immature!
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
Turn that back on!
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
playfully shoves his hand away.
Look who I've found!
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
Bye.
Hello!
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
My name is Gina!
Mummy!
It doesn't matter.
This.
You're such an incredible woman.
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
I'm coming with you.
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
Your insight is enlightening.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Second most common?
Pitbull attacks.
I understand... I won't-
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
Really? Do tell.
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
That was cold...
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
What?
Never to put you in my will.
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
What?
Morgue...?
Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
Ambulance.
Dreams?
Last week...
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
Often, uh.
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
Listen, it's important, Ev, I gotta see him, I got my reasons, very goddamn important...
Me!
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
I... I know that, John...
I... no... I don't have the right... I...
Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
This guy LaPlante won an award?
Unprofessional.
She's talking to him now.
You didn't?
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
I didn't ask him.
Was that your dad?
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
I understand that.
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
You must value your independence.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
Mommy!
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
No.
All new houses have noises.
Where should I hide the car keys?
He wants to see me!
What -- what are you doing?
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
Oh God.
Shit!
What about cable?
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
Neil, do you mind?
Do you see a man?
And this -- is the master bedroom.
Lieutenant?
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
I think it was England.
What?
Detective Bedsoe.
Lieutenant.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
Who are you?
No.  What am I to do?
How comes it your are not afraid?
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
Aye?
Sometimes.
Why?
Do you love me, Conner?
Aye.
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
If it's good advice.
New York is dangerous place.
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
You're twenty minutes late.
You didn't answer my question.
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
It will end tonight.
He's in there!
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer.
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
You kept it?
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
My dreams died long ago.
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
You think we should take that chance?
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
Jesus.  What is this?
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
I'll give you these people.
We been through that.  Forget it.
Let me come get him.
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
I got the gasoline --
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
Where is it?
I need to work out some stuff.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
No one's coming.
Shh, they'll hear you!
What do you want?
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
He didn't say.
Go.
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
Do it.
Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
It's mine.  Talley.
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
Who is it?
Where's your gun?
Your phony FBI assholes.
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
We, who is we?
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
How much?
Ten.
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Yes we have.
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
What is it?
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
Satellites.
The high command? Our high command?
He did.
Whiskey?
Your police are at the gate?
No, sir.
You lie.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
You have no whiskey?
Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big news story out there! We need to get out and cover it.
When will they be here?
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
For supplies, you drive.
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
Who did you call?
What do you want?
How much?
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
How do you know?
This time the Militia will kill us.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
He wants your wisdom.
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
The president has been murdered.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
So where is the lamb?
You cannot go alone.
I have a confession. When we met...
A car.
What sort of car?
What does it matter.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
Can I have your name again?
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
The staff and guests! How many?
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
It's complicated. But don't worry --
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
Oh, for chrissake --
Where is it??
-- I did: down here.
'Less the place really is haunted.
I'll meet you down there.
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Then who are they?
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
No, no, it's just --
I'm ready now.
-- my loss --
What?
He was right! Pritchett was right!
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
-- the window and door grates --
Well, I don't.
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
Ghosts killed your father?
There is something very not normal going on here!
Keep talking, I'll find you!
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
It might have been her mother.
We don't have proof of that.
Are you all right?
A few years older, perhaps.
What do these ingredients mean?
My angel!
Where are we going to go, mommy?
We're going to go someplace new.
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
Help me!  Please!!!
Good night Angel...
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
You're bleeding.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
Where did you find this?
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
I figured I'd make breakfast.
How have you ... ?
But I don't know what's going on.
Would you know this store again?
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
Yes.
Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
Yeah right.  Look ...
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.
This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
Did I miss anything?
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
Welcome to Rome, sir.
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
I hope you know what....
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
You certainly do.
Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
We'll call it the Flying Donut!
Snappy.
The Shazzammeter!
The Daddy-Oh!
The Hoop-dee-doo!
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
You're from Muncie?!
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
I'm sure I --
Well, I --
Smitty.
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
You mean you know about this?
Your i --
Barman! Set'm up, fella!
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
As a three-dollar bill.
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
Just got hired today!
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
Nah, that's all forgotten.
Say, that was a swell idea!
Geez, I --
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Yessir.
'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it?
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
Damnit, where's my car!
...No money.
He don't look wise.
Alive?
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
You don't believe in it?
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
That will mean another interview, won't it?
It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.
Is she a doctor?
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
I wish I hadn't heard --
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
No, Wes.
It is not beautiful.
I'm sorry...
Wesley can be very entertaining.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
I often do.
I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "Paul, darling..."  The whole thing beginning all over again...
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
Wesley!
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
You're staring at me.
I'm, uh, going to bed.
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
Yeah, that one.
What do you mean?
Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Hi dad.
I'm fine dad.
Anyone special? You know...
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
Dad stop it!
Nah.
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
Huh?
You want coffee or something?
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
It's really quite all right.
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Yes, it was -- I ended up --
That's right.
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
Reverend Edwards.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
Yeah.
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
Did you tell Sandy?
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
Hey Wendy.
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Yeah.
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
You did your homework, Officer.
Who's that?
Duggar called him?
What about your shoulder?
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
What are you doing here?
What?
That's right.
Did she?
To do nothing.
He's just rattling your cage.
Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?
What is it?
The other guy?
Since grade school.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
No...
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
There's nothing more to talk about.
Then so was mine...
No back-up.
Wild card.
Ah! You have questions?
What are we?
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
You didn't even warm them, did you?
Your melancholy eyes...
But you're the fairest by far.
You made us what we are, didn't you?
You... fed on me?
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
The ship is sailing wihout us!
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
That's not so.
How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
Give it to me!!!
Let's call that a start.
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
Come, you're going to feed now.
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
I know. It gets cold so fast.
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
Where are we?
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
You followed me here, didn't you?
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
The story about stakes through the heart?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
You promise to care for her then?
Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
What can I do for you?
You're in 201 and 202.
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
Stupid. Stupid.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
He does work hard.
I'm the King of the World.
Julie...
Oh, god, it's you --
You're okay. Thank god.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Can't what?
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
Who?
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
I'm sorry.
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
You sure it's okay with you?
What do you mean, Julie?
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
There was a body! I swear it!
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
He's in it with Willis?
Guess the capital of Brazil --
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Come on, it'll be fun.
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
What is up with that weirdo?
But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
Goodbye.
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
You're just talking nonsense.
We will see who is the first to die.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
All the graves?
No.  She shall not be left here.
Good night, Oliver.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill —— or frightened.
Shh——— it's all right -— I'll be all right.
Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.
What if he is?
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you —- I'll warn them against you.
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in —- entombed —— imprisoned..
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The Vice—Consul at Adrianople brought her to me..
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
I know all you are going to say —-I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -—there is something about her ——the way she moves —— the way she turns her head.
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
Thea, what's wrong?
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" —-
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
I said I wish I'd never been born.
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
What?
Who is it?
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
You sent for me, sir?
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen –– that's Violet Bick!
Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . And I ain't never seen you before in my life.
Of course it's the place.
Mother . . .
Hmmmm . . .
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Mother, you know, I can see right through you –– right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?
Anything I can do back here?
You want a martini?
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
George.
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
What's that?
Where are you going?
No, George, don't . . .
Say hello to New York for me.
Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look –– if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Made up your mind yet?
Well, hello.
Well, why don't you say it?
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
Didn't you tell her?
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
When did you get back?
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Oh, George, George, George.
Oh, Mom –– I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
Huh?
I can't wait to get there.
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
That's awful.
Hey!
Good morning!
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
Chief?
Untie that rope.
I'm going out there.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
Do I have to?
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
What else you got?
Too late, it's written.
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
Do you?
Listen -- what are you doing later?
Door's locked.
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
I know what you're going to say.
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
I know you did....
I'll give notice.
What is it?  What's the matter?
I know, I know....
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof!
Where the hell is Air One?
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
That's what he said.
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
Hi Dad.
Dad!  Dad!
Is that me?
What's wrong?
Ready?
Terry!  You okay?
Help!  Help!
About damn time.
Not tonight.
You're going sailing.
No.
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
We're ready for you.
I'll need more men to look.
You buying?
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
How many sharks have you killed?
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Make up your mind.
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
You want me to stay?
You don't.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
Michael, take deep breaths.
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
How is he?
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
I am.  You're not.
You don't have to prove anything.
Are you okay?
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
We're taking that shark alive!
Get ready to go.
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...
They still seem nervous.
He's a young one.
Sure.  No problem.
Massachussettans aren't.
... Massachussettans aren't.
Depends on big brother.
Sure am.
The one that goes underwater?
Isn't this fun!
Take it up.
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Yes, there is goes.
Make sure you put this back.
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
Can I make sandwiches...?
We need beer....
What the hell are we arguing about?
No fair, I'm not armed.
Close the door.
Sweetheart....
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
You want to try your hand at something...?
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
I'm hungry, Mom....
Don't be late.
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
What?
I want you to give up that terrible job.
I'm not going to quit now....
You and Sean used to make....
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
Promise me....
No....
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
Depends on where you want to go....
How do you like flying?
No, you're not....
A drink with an umbrella in it....
A big one....
Our little island seems to agree with you....
You're always taking time off....
You the architect?
I hope she's a good sailor....
Can't this thing go any faster?
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
They won't fight with me....
Money is money....
I wish you wouldn't say that....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
How long have you known Hoagie?
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
I've got to get to her....
It's my fault...I have to....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
What do you mean?
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
We're going.
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
You believe me, don't you?
Did I say he did?
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
I dunno what I can do to help you?
What exactly you doing, John?
Listen, you don't havta come?
How do you know her hair's black?
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
What does that mean, Sergeant?
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
Why?
I'm going back to the institute.
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Could you just stop moving?
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
Oh Jerry.
Don't let him stay up too late.
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
... this is... uh... too funny...
Now what did you lose?
Well, take care.
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set.
Beer okay?
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
You don't have to explain.
What?
What --
If I said that, would you stay?
I don't need you to "stick."
You want...
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
He's coming over.
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
Oh, thank you.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
Denver is where he should be.
Mmm.  Hmm.
Yes.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Call me tomorrow.
I'll get you some quick work --
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
You don't want to go home, do you?
That's an answer.
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
How can I make your life better?
Don't be silly.
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
... dick?
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?
Hi.
He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.
Oh, my God.
We can't just...
Sorry.
No, it's...
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that’s where he's headed.
He loves you too.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
That does sound lucky.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
A well-accepted theory.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
Do you have any kids?
But then you never get to go in space.
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
That's hard to believe.
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
I don't even know this woman.
Where does it say that?
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
Where do you think you're going?!
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
You're going too?
She's gutty.
Our chance to do what?
?!
Where's Kelly?
It'll hold!
Head for the roof!
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
What's that?
But why?
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
WHAT ARE YOU-
What now?
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Fascinating animals, fascinating.
They smell.
The Cretaceous.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Oh, shit.
No. We can't.
Alan?
Dino droppings?
What's this I hear at the airportŠ Hammond's not even here?
Are they heavy?
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
Tim, are you okay?
Yes it is.
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
Why?
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
Let's go!
Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
Don't do that!
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...
Two.
What?
Who's chest?
He's fucking nuts.
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
How do we prove it?
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
See this?
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
I don't know what you could have read.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
Then its authority is in doubt.
No, I left it in his office.
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
Why would you suppose so?
I'm sorry, but I just wondered --
No.
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
Gabriela! -- you did get away.
Can I ask -- how you found me?
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
I'll bear that in mind.
-- Just doing our job.
Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.
-- You seem amused.
May I ask where your two warders are?
It usually is.
I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
I could always apply there.
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
Get the hell out of here.''!
We're leaving.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
They' re dead.
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
Compassion.
Guess!
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
Do you always have to repeat?
Look -- could I use your phone?
Yes indeed.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
Oh no, I don't think --
You said that.
No, I'm look --
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
-- OK --
What? This?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
And I don't think that was Tom.
You said it was!
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
It's kind of late.
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
Where'd you spend last night?
I called Trina.
Mm.
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
You were hired to look for Tom.
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
Town Police.
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
Are you closing the case?
He's in his room, playing.
Does that distress you?
What do you have here, Billy?
What do you like best about your daddy?
Greatest...
When is mommy coming back?
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
That's okay.
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
I want a pizza.
No.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Yeah?
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.
Did mommy ever see this?
Are you going to get remarried?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
No, son.  Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.
Yeah, there was apple juice.
Daddy!  You're home early.  Did you get fired again?
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
Was he unfaithful?
Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
I was not a failure.
Ted, I'm leaving you.
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
I'm not taking him with me.
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
Ted, do you love him?
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
You want to know why?  I'll tell you why...  Another scotch and soda for the gentleman.  I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore.  Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the 23rd of January.  That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month.  That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child's vacation period.  That's it.
It's going to cost.
Any prospects?
Y'know something Thelma--you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it.  Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
What?
Ted, what are you talking about?!
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
I am sorry, Lhamo.
But, I am in charge.
And you have horses? You love horses.
Where will you keep them?
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
General Chiang.
Soon.
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
So, we must face China and all her might alone.
Yes.
I am him.
In the Pacific Ocean.
Where is Alsace?
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
Can India help us?
One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".
Where is that?
Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
I am scared.
Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
They will take Lhasa next.
Good day.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
True.
Pretend.
I want to go down there.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
We have enemies.
The people want you made Dalai Lama.
I will miss you.
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
Thank you.
We'd only just met.
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
Yup.
Where is he?!
At school they'd always say "go" first.
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow.
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
I never had sex with you!
Such the flirt.
Are you sure?
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
You're gonna be okay.
I'm not making it up.
Who?
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
Excuse me?
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
Well.  Goodnight.
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
What?
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
Get him onto shore.
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
If you get a safe shot...
Did he say anything?
I'm fine, thank you.
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
You think Jack's handsome?
Are you okay?
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
Did you get him?
Sorry?
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
<u>Kelly</u>--
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
Why does she keep repeating the name?
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
What girl?
"- every day."
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
Are you finished?
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
I have no doubt of it.
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
I didn't.
You're a tough one, aren't you?
They all were.
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
Was it a butterfly?
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
Not "just," Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
What?!
How did you learn English?
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
And my compliments to you...
Some say that's the way of it.
Dark haired...
Where do we go from here?
And if we're unlucky?
First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
France.
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
He did.
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
You did good...
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
We're on backup air.
Okay, number 23's full.
Thank you, Martin.
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
Made your million, yet?
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
You read Russian?
It...almost got you.
What's going on?
How far away is she?
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
What on earth's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
What is it?
What is it?
Are you okay, Jonesy?
What's wrong, did you miss me?
I'll kill him!
How much did you part with?
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
It's hit us all hard!
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
What's that?
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
I hate these Southern shites.
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
Is he on his own?
All right, Dad.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
Is there no way they can get back to you?
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
And all your friends, there's a good lad.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
What do you mean?
Who's this fat man, then?
You and me, Tom.
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?
I think I would rather just turn them over.
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
Yes?
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
Look. Go on, look.
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
The money, the gear!
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
So?
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
Sergeant?
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
Charley Wade.
Colt Peacemaker.
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
Do I seem jumpy?
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
You've been in this house for a while?
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
So how come you got into all this?
Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Made some money, came back here--
Something like that.
It's a lead mine.
Hey, Mikey--
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
Seriously, I think we should get married.
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
Treasure hunter?
If the next guy's a redneck.
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
Why would you want to do that?
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
Reputation?
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
'57, 1 believe--
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
Imonna find out one way or the other.
The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
A little older than Paloma is now.
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
Not if I can help it.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
Okay? He's not here?
I don't think you can take it personally--
Could of been. That was white people's business.
You gonna stay out here?
I thought he busted you a couple times.
Your mother still doesn't like me.
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
Yeah--
The Republicans?
Yeah.
You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
Sure.
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
Uh-huh.
You going to tell him?
You heard right.
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
Right.
What about death?
Please.
If you've lied to me to me --
Why did you wait so long?
What is he?
I don't know where you'd start.
I can be very persuasive.
Why?  Because he had you?
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
Oh Christ.
I was so afraid.
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
Are you all right?
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
He got up and walked.
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
With what?
Shit.
Go away.
We've never met.
Philip Swann?
You know of him?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
Any movie stars buried here?
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
I like to know why things happen.
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
D'Amour --
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
The Puritan?
Where'd you learn that?
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
Sure.  Vivovich.
For what?
You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
Oh yeah?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
No.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
This is where we killed him.
Yes! Yes!
You could still help me do that.
Not true.
Yes.
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
Try twenty-five.
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
No, how about you?
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
It's Charlotte.
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
Oh, for her show?
No, yes, it does...
But, I'm mean.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
We established that we have no communication.
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
Nice one.
It's bad isn't it?
When are you leaving?
Hi, Bob.
You're leaving right now?
Is this a bad time?
Uh, no.
It's Lydia, your wife.
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
That's ok.
Hospital?
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
Oh, the record company sent these...
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
Hmmm.
What?  That's horrible!
I'm still shaking.
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
What is it?
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
Peter...Peter Kelson.
Peter Kelson?
Yes... and you are?
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
And the point is?
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
You should think about getting professional help.
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
What are you looking for exactly?
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
There's nothing else here.
Maybe that's my problem.
Plenty of time.
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
There weren't any voices.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Would you sign it for me?
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
Thanks for handling this.
What's up?
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
Ah, Mom.
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
Whatever.
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
There you go.
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
That's ridiculous.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
No, I mean I can check it for you.
Careful.
Sorry.
My mouth is kinda dry.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
So how long is this trip?
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
I know...
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
And he's fine, girl.
How'd you get him to say yes?
I told him you looked like me.
But?
Thanks.
Just like that?
So what are these Spanish guys like?
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
So how come you could play basketball?
He works at a bank.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
What's that?
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
Didn't know you cared so much.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
Didn't know you cared so much.
I can't be nice to a fan?
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
I won.
he's just playing, Q...
You want to go talk?
Hey, what's up.
What the hell's going on?
So that's it, just forget about us?
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
Yup.
We won the championship.
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
Why do you keep asking me that?
I heard enough.
So?
Hey, girl.
Zeke.
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
You scared me.
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
What?
Tell me what?
What's Mom think?
Your teeth are straight.
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
No.
-- do you wanna cup?
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
Just Jim.
yeah, good, ok.
Please, yes.
I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
Really?
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
ok.
Let's make a deal.
It's fine.
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
I'm sorry --
What's your name?
Where's Richard and Julia?
Sure, why?
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
-- no.
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
This sounds threatening.
Well --
I have love.
But you're alright now, so what's the what?
Things go round 'n round, don't they?
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
You don't need braces.
And how much is braces?
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
...ah...
All it takes is one second?
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
She lived in Tarzana.
C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?
Do you have your masters?
Is Linda here?
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
I don't think, he can't...
What? What? What now?
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
And what about screaming?
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
--- What was that?
This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
What the hell is this Marcie?
...you know...
All your other fluzzies?
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
I need you to get me Paula --
I'm gonna need a full name, Stanley.
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
You're my handsome man.
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
That's it.
No.
How long with Paula?
I think that you know.
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
Yes you do.
No.
Are you her boyfriend?
You don't want any water?
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
Where will the money go?
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
Linda --
What are you doing?
You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
What do you do?
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
Let's go,let's go, let's go, you shoulda done that ten minutes ago --
Alright.
It's raining frogs from the sky.
M'lady...?
God smiled upon us.
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
How can I serve you in this?
The Prison of Belle Sur.
Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
Now.  You were saying?
Hang himself?!
Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
Aramis, this will never --
You can't do it.
Everyone back.
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
Who?
Who does?
It worked!
Die?  What...?
Athos, please...!
Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
Phillippe...?
One for all.  All for one.
I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
A personal nature?
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
Sire!  I -- How did you --
You would do that, your Majesty?
Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
Captain Doyle?
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
So what?
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
Where are you?
What do you think?
Find out for me.
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
Alright, where is she?
Yeah?
Something I don't already know?
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
No, but I'm listening.
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
Oh man...what happened?
1490...Breckinridge...
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
Ahh, shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place...
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
Where are you going?
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
Where am I going?
I wouldn't presume to try.
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
Somebody hurt him?
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
Get him to Atlanta.
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
For Christ's sake, why?
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
He's a very shy boy...
Something Lecktor said.
What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
Parking permits...
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
Is that you. D?
I have work to do at the plant.
No. Reba...?
Are you okay...?
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.
Come in.
I want to see Lecktor now.
Hi, Linda. ..
I don't understand.
Do you know something about that?
I don't think I'll tell you.
He's misunderstood.
'Intimate? !"
What happened to them?
We have it good, don't we?
If I were?
At the store. You doin' some good?
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
You haven't smoked in two years.
Can you quit?
Hello.
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
What's this Mama shit?
That's not true.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
I figured I'd ask you...
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
How did it happen?
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
...after a while.
And Hobbs died?
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Yes, I thought so.
You read about it, I'm sure.
Pray tell.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
That's interesting.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
Why does it feel good?
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
Sitcom...?
Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
How long would they let me sleep?
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
But wasn't it funny?
What, you don't think I can beat him?
So how can I help you...?
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
No thanks.
You're NOT DYING!
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
GET OFF!
Then your father's a wimp.
I, I was asked to do this material - -
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
Can I help you with something?
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
Why...?  Andy, why...?
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
Bob Gorsky.
Then the informant is real.
We'll need a search running.
They are dead.  In either case --
... yes.
Is that...?
Dead.  All dead.
Are they any agent?
All right --
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
Give me your phone.
They'll be able to track it.
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
This isn't real?
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
How?
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
Set down in there.
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
And she knows what?  Everything?
And she's never wrong.
What did she tell you?
That's why we're here.
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
What's funny?
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
Who are you?
Gee-zus.
Who is?
What is this thing?
What is it?
We can't leave him!
That I would have to make a choice...
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
Why?
No.
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
How much time?
Operator.
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
What just happened?
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
What are your plans?
Well, we want good stuff.
Yeah.
Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.
Who's the girl?
Nervous?
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
It's the truth, I swear.
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
Don't you move!!!
No.
What pipes?
OK, ok...
No...I'll be ok for a week.
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
You getting out too?
How much was the original loan again?
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
Chinese food?
Take a drink!
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
Oh yes, he's pretty good.
No, she's got epilepsy.
Nothing.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Well...
Did you?
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
Take your time.  I don't care.
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
Scumbag--
I know...I know.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
Look who's talking.
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
I hate parties --
Of course.
Annie made them.
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
That you've been to Susan?
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
What are you eating.
'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.  You like it?
Toast?  No...just the butter.
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
Drew, you're out of line.
We have an arrangement now.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
Why yes, thank you.
Yes.
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
Have we met?
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
I don't care.
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
Obeah evil.  I not evil.
Make it go 'way.
My Doctor Lady?
I am.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
No.  Nothing.
Jennifer.
The Board is waiting.
I didn't know that.
Thanks.
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
Gay?
Thank you.
Did you like making love to me?
Well -- I --
It gets worse.
Will it?
-- Yes?
That's it?
When you go, I go.
No --
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
It is a deal?
Yes, Bill.
Make an exception?
What do you mean?
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
Are you sad, Bill?
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
Uh-huh.
Dinner?  Absolutely.
Why did you go to the hospital?
What way would you put it?
Yes, I saw you see me.
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
Uh --
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
I was just asking, Bill.
Are you threatening me?
He is --
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
I think you know --
Time.
What the hell are you talking about?
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
You're only six-five once.
You're not listening --
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
You're terrible.
Raise away.
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
I love him.
Are you relieved?
I love you, Daddy --
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
What was that?
How'd you know?
38.
That's it?
That's right I did, didn't I?
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
Don't remember.
So I just take your word?
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
It's not easy to be calm when -
What do the police think?
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
He'll kill you, Lenny.
Did you?
No!
Neither do I.
Get rid of Dodd for me.
A BEER, please.
You're the memory guy?
My name's Leonard.							 *
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
Why are you here?
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
She has no idea who I am.
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
How'd you know I was in here?
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
You're not coming?
What's wrong?
You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin -
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
What's your twenty?
With Sonny.  110%.
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
Yes you do...
I got to talk to my ADO...
So...?
What do you like to drink?
So where's the best place for mojitas?
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
Where's she now?
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
Hola, chica.
Would you find me...?
Yeah.
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
So?
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
To the limit.
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
What's your take?
How?
Have faith.
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
How'd they get onto you?
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
Yeah.
What's it say?
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.
There's an E in MONEY. If that's your word.
Cut it out. That's cheating, teasing me so I can't think. Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna beat you!
For money for what?
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
Keep the goddam blanket on.
What you got me up here for?
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Ready for hard work, son?
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
You really want to do business?
Who?
Where you staying, Dad?
Where are the minefields?
...are you with the Consulate?
Got a family back there?
Just Erich.
And you?
What they give you?
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
Okay?
Yeah!
Just got some news on Bell.
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
What is it? . . . Billy?
His name?
Who got the Frenchman out?
Weird shit...?
Is there a switch?
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
What are you doing down here?
What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
He didn't do it!
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
Oh, no, you were-
What-
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
C'mon...
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going.
What are they...?
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
No, what is it?
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
Well, I hope you like it.
I DIDN'T...
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
Perfect.
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
Misery's Return?
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
I want my pills NOW!
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.
Could be the weight of the snow.
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
It's good you found it.
People sure like those Misery books.
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
Answer me a couple things?
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd...
Yeah. They're in the semis.
All done, chief..
Where is it?
Well that depends.
How do you that.
You won.
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
There she is.  I got visual.
What are you doing here?
- torque wrench.
Indeed.
Care to wait a decent interval?
Which is?
So where did I got right?
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
Before you are.
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
What did you think you were doing!
What did you think of him?
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
So what did he say?
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
So what do you suggest?
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
Only four more cars.
Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
Krieger.
There was nobody on the bridge.
I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
Max made a deal with you?
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
You don't think we're going to make it.
Okay...
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
Are you damaged?
Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
Youíre in Prague?
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
Why, may I ask?
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
Bank?
IMF mainframe.
Where exactly is it?
That's not it.  That's not the list.
Claire.
Jack.  Jack.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.
Would you remove your hat please?
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
Then what am I doing here?
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.
And get a doctor.
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
Jack you're so wicked.
Such a nice ass.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
The Shawfish?
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
Hi.  Hi.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
He did?
Yeah.
You're married.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
Why what?
Stupid yourself.
I'm a wolf?
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
She didn't like me.
What did you do?
I'll come to the wedding.
Yeah.
What do you want to do now?
That's right.
Why?
I'm afraid of who I am.
No, I'll tell him.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
What do you mean?
Then let's set the date.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
Have you told her we're getting married?
I can't. I need my family around me now.
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
So we'll sell the house.
How's the mother?
I don't wanna talk about it.
A wife knows.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
I came right from the airport.
Where is she?
You're kidding?
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
That's it! That's the reason!
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Will you join me for dinner?
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
I'm a housewife.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
My God, it's a mansion!
Burn her anyway.
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
Burn them.
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
The Britons.
We don't have a lord.
One that looks nice.
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
What, "is"?
Then you shall die.
You're a looney.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
Nu!
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
What?
Who are they?
Greetings King Arthur.
Look, you're a busy man ...
Oh, shut up.
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
Well ... I AM king.
Bloody peasant! 
The nose?
I think I'll go for a walk.
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
When's your next round?
Why?
I think I could pull through, sir.
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Farewell, Concorde!
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
Do you want to come and have a drink?
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
But, Father.
Leaving the room ... yes.
And make sure he doesn't leave.
Well, she's got a point.
We'll cover your escape!
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!
Look.  I'm warning you.
I done it again.
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
Mary Taylor, sir.
I hope to go up next year.
Checked and locked, sir.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
And that is my last word on the matter.
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
I am a blank sheet.
Surely --
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
What are those?
Who by?
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
What did he want?
What's her excuse this time?
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
Just them?
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
Then why are you not with him?
What do you mean?
You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are...  Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  If you're too late, The Screamer comes.
Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
What's the question mark?
But how can it change every time?
He?
Talk to me.
Did you play ARCADE last night?
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
I came from the city on the left.
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
Where to now?
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
The Police, then...
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
Then where do we go?!
What?
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?
Alex...
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
What?!  There's nothing here!
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
So what do you think?
Can you say anything but "cool"?
So start at the beginning...
Give her a chance, will you?
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
I'm going home Cynthia.
You're broke!
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
You're an understandin' fella.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
There was an accident. I came here.
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
Betty.
You're still here?
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
No. I can't.
Diane?
I don't know.
Unh, unh.
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
Don't stop!
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
So, you came to see if he's out there?
You feel it?
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Interesting.
Where are we ?
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.
First Bank ? But how ?
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
So why this ?
Excuse me ?
Is this really the time ?
What do you mean ?
I work here, remember ?
Yeah a real shame.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
That's not to tough.
What the fuck are you talking about.
Is it over ?
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
You did.
What's wrong ?
I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.
So ?
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Well ?
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
Yes sir.
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
Sir ?
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
One moment dear... 
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.
What the ... ?
Yes.
Hi. I brought some wine.
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
Not now, Mom.
I think we should follow him...
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
How did you know my name?
This is California, anything is possible.
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
Shelly's already told me all about sex.
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Seriously.
So you're saying...What are you saying??
No nuns, got it.
Totally groovy huh?
What happened to Shelly?
I don't know if I want to.
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.
Maybe he's wet?
It's okay really, I was just a baby.
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
What's the matter?
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
I guess you have.
There's water in your bathroom.
Don't wake up Vada.
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
What difference does it make?
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
I think it's cool.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Just come and get it...right here!
You mean,  this ring?
My mother stood on this very spot.
What's he smoking?
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
Muh??
Wow!
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
She lives here too?
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Good morning.
Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
Oh, sure okay.
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
What do you mean?
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
Do you know him?
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
Vada!!
Hey, you didn't pay me!
You are perfectly healthy.
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
They're dead?
Deceased.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
Kinda like men.
Oh, how do you mean?
Are you mad at me?
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
Goodnight Shelly.
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
Dad?
What?
When?
No sweetheart, you can't.
I found this.
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
Oh come on.
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Hi, is Vada home?
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
What do you get for that?
I paid the money.
Please.
Who's that?
No....
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
Do you think she is?
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
She's shy.
He won't give it to me.
Uh huh.
Are you married?
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
What are you saving for?
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
Hey look at this!
You have no personality.
Do you remember her?
What do you think it's like?
Heaven.
Bed wetter!
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
He likes her better than me.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
Like this?
Seeya tomorrow.
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
Blood oath.
You think...
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
Someday she'll thank you.
I wish.
I did what I came to do.
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
How about...
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
But he sure can kiss.
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
I never want to go through this again.
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...
I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
Every day.  She makes the bed.
Waiter! Check, please!
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
I'm up against a deadline.
And your point?
What's up?
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
Lower.
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
Because I could come...
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
... I'm partial to the tight end.
Right here.
Well, that just happened that time.
I hate that music.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
Is there food?
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
You know better than that.
Whose?
Bastard
President?
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
He's my father.
Haven's not going to talk to me.
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
Mr. Green?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.
We don't mess with accessories.
Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.
I don't know his first name.
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.
Yes, it is --
It just is.
No, I don't.
Do you like him?
Linnea?
I'm here.
Wow!
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
I have to go.
Oh.
I'm not sure...
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
You sound different. Is that really you?
Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  Courtland wants to...
Hello. John Triplette.
You know Bill is really mad at you.
I mean...
Probably a little too long.
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
You sure do it loud.
Is that good?
You think I should take lessons?
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
Hasn't it?
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
Thank you, sir.
Susanville, Soledade.
Lobotomy Bay?
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
How is it?
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Yes.
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
I'm sure we will.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?
Let's make a little music, Colorada.
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
And they made the first move?
And a snake-eye glare.
How immediate is immediately?
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
Wayne Gayle.
Why?
How so?
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
People seen him 'round.
Guess I don't.
Where was your father born?
You must be new in town.
I'm a teacher.
Went to college, huh?
In Birmingham.
Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
How come you stay 'round here?
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Ain't your fault.
Surprised?
How did it go?
I'll have some coffee, please.
How about it?
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
I can see why.
You didn't answer my question.
Don't, Duff.
You will.
Day work.
Don't do that!
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
Ain't you goin' to say something?
When I get set, I'll send for you.
Okay.
How 'bout the key?
That's right.
'You Will Anderson?
Wouldn't have known you.
How about a drink?
'Don't sound so sure.
Great.
My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?
Want me to hold the light for you?
Seems a little loose!
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
How often does he get like that?
Well, what're you going to do?
That's right.
No, they won't.
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
It ain't in me.
So I been told.
Well, if it ain't Duff!
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
Well, I got married to one of them.
I understand.
Hi.
Let's go.
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
Since when?
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
You're hurt...
What's an A.I.
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
What does this have to do with me?
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
You've got your orders.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
I don't have a girl.
All things possible in Babylon.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
We run. You crack the pattern?
You can make your move when it comes after me.
It'll flatline your ass.
How much time you got left?
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
What about the route to the core?
Wait... You hear that?
What's my end?
Holy shit...
That's not going to help.
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
On a good run... yeah.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
Get up.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
What?
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
– uhh, must have forgotten-
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
That is lingerie.
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
Hidden camera.
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
He is totally crunching on you.
A--flack jacket.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Do you even know these kids?
He's my teacher!
Rob's?
Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
God, I can't do this.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
I love the way she writes.
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
Are you having fun?
Not at all!
He sure is big, Jack...
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
You're mine, you know.  I made you.
Coming...
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
What are you talking about?
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
Oh, please...
Come back here!
Who told you to choke up that way?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
Are you sure?
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
Here.
Anything?
Disappointed?
About not finding any bogey men?
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
Hi.
All of them.
You're going out?
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
What's happening?
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
I used to live in this house.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.
Those are ancient history.
This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
It's over.  It's over.
Ms. Thompson.
Call me Nancy.
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
I can't believe I just did that.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
You sound like Peter Pan.
Your dreams?
What are you talking about?
What was that?
What?
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.
Uh, fourteen.
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
I'm a vegetarian.
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
Well, they can be.
Fifteen million dollars.
No.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Too complicated.
That's fine.
Nothing.
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
You and every person in this country.
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
Can I stay a bit longer?
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
But... wait... there are things to say.
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
Anna Scott?
Yes -- sort of...
Bloody hell, this is fun.
And we intend to use them!
Di Caprio.
Me?
I was called and I came.  What's up?
What happened?
'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.
Yes?
Ah... yes, enormously.
That's right -- Topol.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
You haven't slept with her, have you?
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
May I help you, sir?
Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
And she's in your house.
Yes.
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
No -- you're right.
Yes, Mister Harding?
I was in luh-love with her.
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy.
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Good. Why don't you join us?
Whatcha boys playin'?
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?
Ahhh, Billy...
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Yeah...
Sock it to 'em, kid!
In there.
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
When do you think we'll be going back, Mack?
He can't hear you!
What's your plan, Mack?
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!
No!
Who told you that?
Yeah, buddy?
Can you borrow me a dime?
'Kay, place your bets.
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
I don't, Doc...
That's correct, Doc ...
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
Time out!
Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?
'Kay, Mac!
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Now you talkin'.
Evenin', ma'am.
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.
Your grandmother?
I-- I must've misplaced it.
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Where are you going?
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
You said whatever it was you would understand.
You're limping.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
Where's Positano?
Uh, I'd rather not say.
Mickey Spillane.
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
You were saying...
Yeah.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
There's no such thing.
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
Well, not exactly...
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Well, to-- new friends.
So what do you think?
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
Now what do we do?
We're saved!
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
Because I'm the one who's single.
He's heeeeeerrre...
Oh my God.  Where?
I think it's time we got some professional help.
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
Maybe I can change him.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
And Larry?...
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
Giovanni.
No, why?
What?  You know him?
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
Right now?
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
That's right... .
Don't say that!
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
What happened?  What happened?
They're waiting for him to walk in.
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
You training to be a nun or something?
I don't know.
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
I— I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And— I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
But you've got to listen to me.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers— and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you—  — Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
Now don't give me a hard time.
Who asked him here?
You all right, Nolan?
Nice fellows.
You still call it ratting?
Baseball bats— that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
Better.
I'll bring him up to your loft.
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
Can't we get out of here?
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
Be careful!
You're talking nonsense.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
She was?
Ahh, she will be yours.
I will decide the conclusion.
Oh, if there is only time!
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
For what!?!
You mean...!
Is there time?
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
Aannnnaahhnn.
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
I'm not dressed.
I'm just saying she wasn't scared.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
I'm a tourist.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
You tell your sister about it?
Just hung up.
How long you talk to her?
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
Half for doing what?
They look like plain old rocks.
Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
And what happened to Carl?
You get the key?
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
Ironic, isn't it?
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
Let's go outside and talk.
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
If I could have a little more room.
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
You don't act like it.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
Don't leave me.
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
I like your hair.  And that suit.
You know I saw you on the street.
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled."
I hear six.
When?
Looks like tonight.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
How are you, Richard?
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
I'm not leaving Midge.
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
You busted out?
That time?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
And so now you're off to Glades.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
Do we have a gun in the car?
Take the next exit.
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
What's going on, Glenn?
Why's that?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
Uh-huh.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
Gimme another hint.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
Thing I'm worried about is you.
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
Flyweight.
I'm looking for Maurice.
You like to sit down?
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
Oh, he's moved out?
No thanks.
Dad...
I really gotta go.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
Out for the evening?
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
Only when I'm n-n-n-
Yes Sir.
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
Where's that lizard?
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
Home of the brave!
Then why are you looking for her?
Waitress!  Four beers!
So what are you saying?
Get me into a plane!
What's there?
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
No.  You're trying to beat me.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
No baseball diamonds, Red.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
You take care, Dorie.
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
It must of been a convincing letter.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
I have'na been able ta --
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
You see us as capable of such a blow?
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
That's disgusting!
Peggy Sue!
Charlie...
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
Charlie! Am I dead?
I call this the staccato. 
Where did you get that sweater?
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
What am I going to do with you?
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
What?
I've got to go now.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
Coffee and a donut.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
Damn that Charlie I
Thank God for that.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
I closed my Christmas club.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
The hat business is in trouble.
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little light—headed.
Does everybody have to hear?
I have a note.
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
What happened to you?
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
Are you doing some kind of science project?
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
You're giving me the creeps.
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
What are you doing?
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
I was building a doggy door.
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
Hey! How was your first day at school?
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
What's his name?
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
I'm not burying him here...
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
How long have you been here?
What was the file name?
K-R-O-one.
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
It could be parasites, an infection...
You're going to the office?!
We're not skipping this treatment.
What's wrong with you?
That's not what I said.
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
I'm ready...
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
Innocuous?
Little baby girl.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
My lover and I.
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
What kind of person is that?
I suppose you could say that.
Are you a good lawyer?
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
Were you recently promoted?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
Objection!
Why are we going to do that?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
Right.
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
Aren't you?
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
Attorney for the plaintiff?
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
Jesus.
You came for us....
Probably okay to talk to me now.
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Bring the light!
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
They're coming.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
Why, what'd you hear?
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
Back to the ship, huh?
As fast as you can.
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
I would try for them.
You barely know them.
Like the light is scalding it.
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
I never said I was.
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
How much?
79 kilos.
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
Hasan?
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
The sled as a shield....
Oh, no. No, no, no....
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.
Very big beads.
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
How did you know we'd come here?
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
Do you have any weapons?
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
Where does the river lead?
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
What are you doing there?
What's so special about him?
Now, just a minute --
Geiger counter?
Yo!
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
This place is dirty, doctor.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
Landon! Join the expedition.
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
Climb off me, will you!
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Can we take a dip?
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
I want her.
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
He wouldn't leave her.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
Twelve hundred years ago.
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
Yes.
Taylor, please --
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
This is his assertion.
How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
But there's the doll, sir.
Bunker...
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
How the hell did he get away?
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
Fuck you bitch.
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Say I can dig it. Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know?  Y'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become 'pacifists' so's we don fight  Where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what - bunch of hopheads, they think they special...
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
Come on you can do better than that!
You lame Taylor?
What?
Then what do you suggest big shot?
I was wrong.
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
But what'd she actually do?
...beautiful night.
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
You wanted to see me sir?
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
I really don't know.
I don't know.
I'm supposing.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
I'm sure you have.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
Immigration Officer?
You're drinking it.
Do you think I don't?
There wasn't any plane.
Bad?
There's a lot of night left to live through.
Is this the best you can do?
Why not?
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here, put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when. 
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
Do you think I was faking?
Ale. I don't mind.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.
Who hasn't--one way or another?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
If I understand what you meant by that.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
Sometimes.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
Name it.
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
A thousand.
Got the information on you?
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
Could be.
How are you two getting along?
You'd be breaking the law.
Doesn't answer the question.
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
It could have been an accident.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
Mr. Mitchell.
I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
He saw my face too.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
Floater?
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
I've met her.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
No doubt about that one.
He checks too.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
Not too far, I hope.
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
I have a rough idea.
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
It's fine, thank you.
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.
Now first of all, tell us your name.
How's Mary?
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
Yes, please.
Thank you.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
You don't trust me.
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
Blasé and epicene.
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
Not bad.
Hello, Jimmy.
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.
What's their program?
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
A little mushy.
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
That's the point, isn't it?
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
This gonna take long?
What?
My name's Johnny Utah!
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
Where the hell is his body?
He knows our defenses.
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
No.
You don't know anything about me.
I... I would take advantage of it.
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
Fine.
What's your name, lover.
Why?
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Just a romantic, that's you.
What do you like?
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
You're upset, huh?
Television?
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
I more than liked it.
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
I'm here.
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
We're letting them slide?
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
Yes...
You're being ridiculous.
What!?
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
'Lo.
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
Kit give me nothin'.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
May I help you?
Are you looking for something in particular?
Yes?
Yeah.  Thanks.
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Then I'm here till I die?
You don't believe me?
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
Of course you will.
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
Well ... you were dead.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
Gently.
What?
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
I only dog paddle.
But you don't know where he is.
-- Fezzik, please --
Yes.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
No.  To the pain.
Who won? How did it end?
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
And our assets?
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
Then make your choice.
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
You feeling any better?
You are sick, that's why he's here.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
I'll wait in the hall ...
Do the books!  Do the books!
Well, sir, it seems ...
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
What kind now, Leo?
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
It won't run a week!
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
Really, I never dreamed ...
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
We swear it!
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
Always.
Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
I shall count the minutes.
Heil you know who!
Okay.
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
No.
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
I'm not the police.
No one met her?
No.
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
Cash.
What's your interest?
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
Why?
Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
He didn't come back here?
Where could he have gone?
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
No.
Sam, let's go get married.
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
I'm sorry.
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
Arbogast.
Just coming up to ring for you.
It isn't necessary.
Do what?
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
Yes.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
Who are you? What is your name?
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to call the police.
There's no child here.
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
But what about lunch?
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
It happens that I'm the law.
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
We'll grant that.
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
That's what I said.
I don't remember. Not so very far--
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
I told you he was a sore.
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- 
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
Who'd steal her body?
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
She is the soul of that statue.
Could be.
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
What did it want?
Why?
They're filthy, Mother.
What did you expect?
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
Okay.
What are you going to do, Rose?
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
You were up late last night, Brother.
Yeah, he's still up there.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
Let's go peep from the living room.
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
They're discussing it.
This is my place and you can't have it.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
Why is it taking so long?
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
That's what she would say herself.
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
I am not being brutal to her!
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
She hasn't actually done anything...
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
Is this ill right?
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
I got an awful bad cold.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Well, it's Billy.
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
Your baby?
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
What's the matter with him?
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
Illusions, Madam?
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Yes, Ma'am.
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
You get nothing and like it.  And if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
This is private property.  This is breaking and entering!
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
You shouldn't litter.
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
Sons of bitches!
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
Slow down.
Get his attention.
You suck at lying, Archie.
We're screwed.
No more counting the big money for someone else.
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
Do tell.
The gang's all here!
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
Yoda spoke of another.
Where am I?
As you wish.
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
Ugh!
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
But, why must you confront him?
Told you, did he?
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
Oh. Well, yes.
How many languages do you speak?
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
So please don't tell me to can it.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Weiss.
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
Great Heavens, that's a laser.
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
Free to try and find a game
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
...I don't know.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
...I suppose.
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
...Guess.
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
I don't think I belong here.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Yes.
Like?
...What?
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
Paulie!
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
You busted?!
You's the novelty, Champ!
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
No doctor!
One more round.
Damn.
How was the flight, Champ?
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
Few minutes?
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Ya still light seventy.
You think I don't hear things?
Yeah.
No action.
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Why?
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
Did ya win?
Did ya get the message, kid?
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Freak luck for sure.
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
Yo, Benny.
How you holdin' up, kid?
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
...What kinda dog is this again?
It don't matter.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
Ya really like her?
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
Apollo's a great fighter.
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
You?
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
I didn't know who I could trust.
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
What the hell is that?
So what do you want me to do?
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
Does this help?
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
I'll get it.
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
No better?
Leave Me!
Then I'll leave thee.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Farewell, my cuz.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
How well my comfort is revived by this.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
I thought all for the best.
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.
And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
Not to me, you know that.
About time!
Hazard pay...
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
Is that right?
Now, what did we steal?
Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
Are you alright?
Who are you?  IRA?
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
Not so fast.  Who's that?
He's company.
Where's my information?
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
How so?
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
Long enough to shoot back.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
You should learn a little patience.
Where to?
To see a man about a thing.
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
Lovely, isn't it?
How did you know?
Know what?
We live in a singular world, my friend.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
You know him?
What's this?
I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.
It is at that.
You think?
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
That's a good question.
You have to stop doing that!
You speak French.
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
You slept with her!
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
Dwayne listen to me -
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
No.  We can't.
It won't work.
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
What are you thinking?
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
It's NOT too late!
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
I'm all ears.
You mean that guy was an agent?
Yeah.
Nothing happened?
That son of a bitch.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
I know.
I love you Sally.
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Uh, no...
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Hmmm...
Shopping here?
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I’m a busy man.
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
What?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Dwayne -
Hi ma.
I didn't know you were coming.
Did they ever find out who they were?
Don't you want it?
Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
I don't think so.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
So what's your story?
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
No.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
It's my job!
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
What?
Why LA?
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
No.  It's not right.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
I don't understand?
It's your turn!
There's people up here!
Why did you help me?
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
Yes.  We have heaven.
What's a Chinese heaven?
No mu-shu.
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
What is Mac out?
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
I didn't know which side you were on.
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
I know, Master, but...
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
Beach Boy.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
I know a shortcut.
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
Don't go there...
What?
Stool pigeon.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
You like it?
You want more?
Now, that's American music.
You know War?
Want some?
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
Like that.
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
Oh my god. Griffin.
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...
What are you talking about?
Hello.
Hello.
Han?
I do.
He is very good.
What is he up to now?
Right.
Fisher, let him talk.
In vino veritas.
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
And you are?
Like her mother.
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
It's fun!  It's high.
I already explained about that.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
I'd rather not.
You were not.
Reporter?
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
No.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
You don't love me, is that it?
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
You take the microwave?
I hate boats.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
Walter, I'd love to --
Does it have wheat in it?
About forever.
-- it was a betrayal.
I told you.  Nothing --
Actually, he sounded nice.
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
No.
I love that dream.
Okay.
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
Are you Annie?
What?
It's probably just the flowers --
It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
You know.
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
And you're worried about him.
I don't know --
What is it?
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
It's never happening again. Right?
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
What do you think?
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
Jonah, I'm leaving --
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
Everyone at work heard you.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
What if I couldn't get to you?
When I found you?
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Hi.
It's a little derivative.
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
Whose side are you on anyway?
The woman question?
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
They are singing for me.
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
I'm a fool.
What's the matter?
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
Where are you going?
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
But honey ...
The what!
You've got to help around the house!
Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
What attitude?
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
Bobby?
I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
You get off on abuse or something?
How far out of town?
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
Is that how you play?
: What are you up to?
It gets me through the day.
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
Why not?
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
Why?
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
What time is it?
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Danny?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
You're serious?
If you say so.
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
I'm sorry?
Now get talkin'
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
It's not my place.
I was getting to it.
This chink have a name?
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
To who?
He's the only one I told.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
Really?
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.
Resistance?
So, where are you from?
As a matter of fact, I am.
In West Fork?
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
Yes, sir.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
Say what, Cap'n?
Upham?
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
I wonder where they're going.
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
But, sir...
GO!
You think they'll be alright?
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
You're welcome, John.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
What are we going to do?
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
Lingerie.
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
Because he's guilty.
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
Hang in there, man.
I am.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
I'll put this past my boss
Ha!
I just had a phone call.
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Lloyd?
You're going.
Do you love him?
Dad, are you okay in there?
Honey, it's not what you think.
No, but you stole from them.
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
Mom, please?
Whoah, what a day, huh?
I'll go.
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Keymaster?
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
Twisted?
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
No, I'm serious.
Then call me tomorrow.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Yeah?
Yes.  Are you shaking?
No.
Why didn't you tell me?
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
You shared it with a dick.
One more time would be nice.
PAIN!
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
No, really.
Just her name.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
Lloyd.
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
Hey.
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
Later for you, Luke.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
You know what, you'd like her.
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
He's important to my business.
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.
The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
Yeah.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
I need a drink.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
Pots and pans.
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
I'll talk to him.
That's very generous of you.
They're withholding payment.
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
I would say we are now officially baffled.
thought he was doing AA.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
I won't.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Who is this?
Hello? Ted?
I live here.
I thought you were going to the mixer?
I did that.
Did it?
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
And much richer as a result.
Hi, Gale, any leads?
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
Jesus Christ!
Don't worry...
Just in case...
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
Who is this?
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
Someone’s trying to kill me. I need the police.
Who is that guy?
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
Her old boyfriend?
Gale?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
I get scared really easy, okay.
Do you work for her now?
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
Four? There are five.
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
Are you sure?
What does this have to do with Sid?
And what made you think it was Sidney?
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Always.
Jennifer needs me.
Your life?
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
I am Gale Weathers!
Need to get in that building?
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
Are you saying she was-
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
I know!
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
Who's this?
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
Where?
Owwww...
How'd you do?
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
You rode your bike out there?
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
It's been a year since she died.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
What number are you trying to reach?
I don't know.
Hello.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
What did you say?
I have to go now.
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
I wanna play a game.
...please...
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
...please... no...
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
What kind of lead?
I like it. It's... sexy.
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
You girls ready.
Yeah.
Have they found my father?
What? What?
What's the delay?
I'm not here to fight.
Off the record. No cameras.
Why would she lie about it?
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
Stu was with me last night.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
Jesus, this place is packed.
Which is you...
Or a man's mentality.
Just like old times, ain't it?
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
For once, Stu, drop it.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
What am I? The beer wench?
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
No, I haven't heard.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
It's always been like this.
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.
Who tied her down?  You or him?
Give me the gun.
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
A woman...
We would have gotten you eventually.
You just met me.
Same color and texture.
This doesn't make any sense.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
I know.
Oh, that's all.
Bullshit.
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
Why would we?
We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
You got to be kidding.
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
What are you going to say?
He's preaching.
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
Where's the victory?
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
You should look into private schools.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
I want to have children.  It's just...
Did the wife confess?
Did their son see it happen?
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
What in...?
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
JOINT action?
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
Well, the reward still stands...
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
Yes, sir.
Say it. We're beat!
And you think we got a chance to find her?
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
That don't make 'em kin...
Futterman?
You ask her!
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
Might at least have left me my pants!
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Who was that?
So, did you sleep good?
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
I've killed my husband!
Twenty-three, to be exact.
Ned…I know…I know
Oh…what have I done?
Thank you, my lady!
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
A woman of property?
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
I have a wonderful new play!
Oh, that.
How?
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
it will be all right, madam.
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Cut round him for now.
Kit
Good title.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
Do you think?
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
And I love poetry above all.
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
I have lost my gift.
"Ay me."
Better fortune, boy.
Who is there?
Even your play.
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
An excellent beginning  Let him be…a duke. And your heroine?
Orsino…good name
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
I am going to church.
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
I was trying to educate you.
Only on expenses.
When are you going to let the police know?
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
How much did you pay?
Not at all.
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
Cover it?
For the flat.
Who was it?
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
So?
Don't look?
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
Sshh.
What's he doing here?
That's not him.
And the money?
No.
You're frightened.
Everything.
Alex.
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
You were going to say something.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
It's about the burglary.
No, three. Who said there were four?
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Eh, I don't know.
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
Would you like to come in?
A priest who dies.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
No.
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
Yes.
Diseases.
Offering it for debate.
Don't you think there's too much gold?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
Don't you like her?
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
Why?
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
It turned out to be cancer.
I don't want to talk about it...
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
-- What?
I don't want to place you in any position --
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
Well, is she your girlfriend?
I do her hair, yeah.
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Well, are you?
Don't make conversation with me.
I am not!
How is she?
Yes, Buffums.
What!
Jill's really great, isn't she?
You don't seem very sure.
Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
It's hot in here.
And?
Did Lester know about him?
You know what I'm talking about.
Yeah?
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
One of my few virtues is discretion.
No! Don't! Please!
What are you talking about?
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
-- what?
You don't think so? I do.
-- yeah.
-- what?
What's wrong?
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
What for?
-- Right after I sprayed her?
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
-- took a bus.
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
Where?
George, I don't --
How?
You're great.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Okay, baby. Okay...
Go where?
Egypt!
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Okay.
George.
I want your feelings about it.
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
When is that?
When is that, George?
What?
A friend dropped me off.
Never mind. Where've you been?
Look at the way I live.
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
That was him.
Yes.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
What difference does it make?
What? What? What? What? What?
That's all you've got to say?
Did you?
Yes, yes, I did.
What did you say?
No.
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
In a way. But...
But what?
Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
I don't know what to...
Well, what?
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
Want a drink?
What about Jackie?
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
What took you so long?

No.

And?
Well maybe I can get you something.
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
Is that right?
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Shut the door, shut the door!
They get hair all over the place.
Aren't you going to have one?
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Fine.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
George is great but I know what you mean.
You're really a love -- you sure?
Nothing.
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
It's been so long I don't how long?
Well, there was this one time --
-- uhh-huhh...
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
Why don't you ask for another one?
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
-- his car. They have it blocked.
-- there's not much room --
You seem disappointed.
No of course not.
Dad?
What?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
Yes, Dad.
Chocolate.
Room 237?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
To my stomach.
Shall we go into the living room?
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
It's good to see you.
No charge?
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
Yes...
Jack, stay away from me!
Wendy...
Go away.
Well...
can of itself be a problem.
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
What's that?
Sure.
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
I told you!
There! You see!
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
But Uncle Al! You said-
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
What you say?
Okay, Christy -- strip.
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
Sure.
Oh, girls.
Oh-huh.
What is it, Betty?
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
I... I brought you something.
Bobs
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
I don't want to mess anyone up...
It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
Don't you know it!
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
The reason?
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
No!  No!  I can't do this!
A what?
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
A vote?
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
I hate you.  I totally hate you.
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
Me too.
I have?
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
A nun?
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
We've got to save her!
I'd rather sing than do anything!
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
... Brom Bones...
You need to sleep.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
How could he?
Are you familiar with magnets?
What is it?
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
What now?  Where is she?
Forgive me, I didn't know.
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
Small talk.
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
You made this, and the drawings?
If you want.  But...
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
I... I can't do this.
No.  She has gone out.
There was not much blood, was there?
Can you help?
He rides tonight.
Father saw you die.
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
I can't remember.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
I'll see you, Bill.
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Leave.
Leave.
You got that shit right.
I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.
They let you out?
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
You told me to come by.
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
How did your mama die?
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
Why did he do that, reckon.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
All right then.
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
Why not? It died?
Why?
A little ol' boy.
I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
You all right, Mama?
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
I ain't got nothing but them books.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
You scared me.
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.
Right now?
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
I reckon not.
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
Before they were married?
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
Yes.
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
Will that be cash or charge?
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
I'd love to.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
What about for you?
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
What's that, Sol?
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
What do you mean?
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
So what did he say when he called?
Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
You're looking good, Auggie.
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
You what?
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
No you're not.
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Lovely.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
What is this, some kind of joke?
I think I'll take them. 
The refrigerator?
Thanks for the tip.
I figured he had a right to know.
And?
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
Not a one.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
Aren't you going to say anything?
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
Yeah? And why is that?
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
Here and there. Around.
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
Hey, it's you.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
No wonder he was angry.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
How do you want that cooked?
Fries?
Yes, please.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
That's obvious.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
Why?  If they could never take title.
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
My mom.  Would be the problem.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
Yes.  Initially.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?
You said three minutes.
Maybe...?
You always run with the well open?
White or black?
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
No spare.
No.
I don't think so.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
The same.
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
Bye.
Those idiot broads!  Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens?  The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant.  I ought to fire you, Bienstock.
Funny?  In what way?
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
You're right, Joe.
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
With me?
And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
Tore off one of my chests.
What happened?
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
You think he's too old for me?
Oh.
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
OH!
I'll say.
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
But there's one thing I envy you for.
What's that?
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
I guess she's not in here.
Did he get fresh?
Where did you girls play before?
- and you got to be girls.
Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Please.  It won't happen again.
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
I'll throw up!
We can have it altered.
I forgive you.
We'll adopt some.
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
You're making it up pretty good so far.
What's the job?
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
No - funerals.
Running away?  From what?
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
Have you ever been with a male band?
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
Men!
You're entitled.
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
Thank you.
Who are you?
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
No, my flag steward.
You're society girls?
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
Shell Oil?
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
Three?
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
I don't mind if I do.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
It's the crews' night off.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
Nothing at all?
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
I think you're on the right track.
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
You're not?
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one?
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Why?
I sleep with my spats on.
Yes, sir.
I already told you.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
Whatever you do, don’t mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Where’s Nick sleeping?
There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
What?
And Kat was fully clothed.
Not for a dog.
It’s the past. It’s nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then let’s go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
What color are my shoes?
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
Who are they?
I have a friend at the magazine.
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
You shit!
It’s hard to explain.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It’s all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you’re not walking away!
Hi.
You want me to let him in?
That’s not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
I’m worried. Amy’s not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it ‘drunker’ or ‘drunker-er’?
I’m guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
... So me and Sounder, ran right by the men that was the prisoners, and crawled under the fence! That's when I cut my hand on the glass. It hurt like mad! But I kept runnin', and then I didn't feel no more hurtin' till I stopped runnin'!  Why was that, Miss Johnson?
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
Yes, Miss Johnson...
Go on...
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
But, Charlie --
Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!
Yes, sir...
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
Son, that was some trip you went on...
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
When's that?
What's in there, David!?
I don't look like no possum!
I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
Did you find your father?
Be good and be smart, little boy.
I'll walk...
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
I wanta get some things.
Hi ya, Rebecca...
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
What did he want?
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
<b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
Mkay.
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
MOM!!!
SHIT!
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
It's so very cold...
We can't leave without you!
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
I don't know, dude.
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
Oh, brother.
Stan!
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
Who's my cream puff?
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
I know.
Did you see that, Wendy?
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Stan! Stan are you okay?!
Cool!
You don't have watches?
Evening.
It can't be.
Well I appreciate that.
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
And what are they doing now, Mac?
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
You gotta think of your old age.
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Idiot...
Break it down to me, what's going on?
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
Marry you?
What is happening around here!!!
How am I supposed to know?
What the hell is that?
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
Is it safe for human transport?
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
Nope.
Sorry about your loss.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
You look like you're something on the lanes.
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass.
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
What about bowling?
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
I don't like to talk about it.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
What if he wants to get out?
How Mr. Kastle?
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
What's your specialty?
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Where did your brother escape from?
Why not?
It's Junior, isn't it.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
It?
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
What about plan C?
Very professional.
Who identified the body?
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
Open it, Captain!
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
But you've tested it?
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
What have you been told so far?
Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.
How deep is he?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
-- Wait a second --
It doesn't make any sense.
What team?
What is it, Norman?
Picked up something?  What is it?
What?
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
What do you mean, he's missing?
When was this?
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
You think he killed Edmunds?
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Can you open that panel?
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
Yes, Harry.
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
With an "o".  Harold with an "o".
A half a mile long?
Look at this.
Sir, about leaving --
It never occurred to me.
The timing has never seemed quite right.
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
Don't do this.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
Wait a second --
Squids?
Riordan?
Parasolutrine?
Causes sleep.
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
For what?
You think I'd really drink that?
Don't you?
Are you manifesting them?
He can't manifest.
You think I manifested the snakes?
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
You manifested that, Beth.
But I have to, Norman.
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
What is that?  What are you doing?
Would it work?
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
Then what is it?
Is it coming from our own computer?
I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
Page 87 of what, Harry?
... you there?  Norman?
Her suit's gone.
Missed.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Nine hundred feet to surface.
How's that working out, by the way?
What is it, Harry?
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
Meaning?
Beth and Harry?
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
You mean you don't know?
Squint harder.
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
Well, we'll see...
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
I'll get the information.
Good morning!
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
You mean I generate an energy field?
That's where my father was killed.
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
Are you sure you don't need it?
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
The Kiber Crystal.
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
Why didn't you say so before.
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
They'll find its weakness.
No!...
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
You rich kids... are all the same !
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
You always told me you couldn't do human...
Johnny, this is Zander.
Hey ! What are you doing here ?
Profile's wrong... there.
Carmen...?
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
How do you feel about him now ?
I don't know, Zander.
She's flying starships !
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
I don't want everyone to see.
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
Why not ?
How do I know if this is love ?
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
...I'm sorry.
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Uh, look, Diz...
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
Hey, Diz...
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
What do you think you're doing ?
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
Kill the bitch.
Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.
Where is Lt. Ilia?
Who is V'ger?
<U>Why</U>...?!
They have repressed the Creator.
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
Captain, what's the next move?
Forward motion, Captain...!
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
They had a pattern to follow...
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
Sure plan to.
I want to rent this one.
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
No, I don't...
...lost the screw...
Never saw the point of 'em.
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
Why?
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
Why?
Yes.
You'd do the newspaper right here.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
But that's what happened.
What are you going to do?
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
What is it, a surprise?
That's so beautiful...
I have to tell you something...
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
Fourteen year old girls.
Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
What do you drink?
What else?
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
You look at:  girl comes in the room, an <u>apron</u>, a brown <u>bag</u>, what is she...? She's a...
Thank you.
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
Claire, when did you...
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
I can't do it, Walt.
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
...I...
...yes...
We, we have to give it.
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
That's cor...
Did she throw up?
You said <u>three</u>...?
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
Main Street.
What is the...?
He told you that...
Later for you, pal.
And what was it you wanted to say?
The writer.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
I...
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
I can't find the writer.
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
I know the feeling.
You want me to lie.
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
No.
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
It's lovely.
I don't got the money.
We don't have the money.
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
...not at all...
We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
What are you gonna talk about?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
Actually.  I could only help him.
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
I don't want to say goodbye.
Yes.
I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
Your mom had to...help a friend with this...emergency?  And she called me. And we switched days.  Then, I got stuck on my shoot, and...
Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --  We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
I have lava.
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
So you're okay.
Before you.
Ben where do you have to get to?
Planning on getting --
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
I'm afraid she's going to walk.
We...
WE are over.
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
You feeling all right?
Don't flatter yourself.
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
See, I know that.
Okay, I'm undeserving.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
It's the same choice you made.
Looks nice enough to m...
Are we.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
Aw.
Thanks for coming out.
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
But?  But what?
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
It's just an assignment.
They're my kids.
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
Maybe he's gay.
Don't ever say that.
What if he is?
Out! Leave the table!
What?
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
Oh.
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Yes, Mikey?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
I did not go to high school.
We had to work. My family was poor.
I'm still poor.
Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
The camerawork's nice.
We used pull.
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
Huh?
I can read it to you.
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Oh. What happens now?
You know he hated my story also.
So? How was school today?
Yeah?
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
Come here, give me a hug!
What are you doing here?
Uh huh.
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
...gger.
Any books you like to read for fun?
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
I hate reading.
Great!
So what's going on?
So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
That's too bad.
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
That's good.
Thanks.
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
What for?
Whoopee.
So where'd you get in?
Hey, um, Toby? I was wondering…Is the documentary almost finished?
What is most important to you?
What are we going to do!
What now?
What happened?
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
Are the labs in operation?
I don't want any...
Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
What about Cooper--where is he?
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
We can't--it's power driven!
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
Do you recognize my voice?
No, sir.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
Yes, sir.
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
I know that, sir.
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Where, sir?
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
Then there's no chance for recall?
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
General, stick to the point, please.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
What else could it be?
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Just the missiles.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
They must have made a visual contact.
I've got one.
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
Primary bomb is live.
What happened?
What do you mean?
Look, this is different.
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Who's that?
Are you sure?
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Yeah.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
What did you guys think?
Typical male.
Typical male.
Your a nurse?
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
It's your birthday?
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
You know what we should do? Go to the...
No, no.
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
No, no, I wasn't trying.
No, I'm not worried.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
Oh, and guess who showed up.
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Erica is in the van back there.
Hey, man.
What she doin' in the van, man?
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
Great.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
No, but I heard it was great.
Yeah!
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
What was your name again?
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
It's nice to do a lot of things.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
Mm.
I'd love to read that.
It's coming along.
Uh-huh.
Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
This is my home.
Jeff! Come up here!
I don't know.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Was that supposed to be me?
Your sure as hell right about that.
Nothing.
Jeff!
Come on.
I, yeah.
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
Oh, no, no, no.
You're unbelievable.
You really suck, you know that?
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
The prom. That's funny.
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
You do not want me to do your cover.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Jesus, Jeff.
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Yeah?
Oh, How'd she get back?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
You sure?
No.
Hi, Jack.
Yeah.
Jack...
If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get -- mm-Jack, pull over.
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
Roll 'em.
Hi, Artie.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
With a wildly beating heart.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
He thinks it could be made into something.
Why should you do that?
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
Check.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
You're tough, all right.
Good.
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
It must be my new shampoo.
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
No.
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
Gordon Cole?
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
It's a good script, isn't it?
I wouldn't know.
Get out.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
Just a minute, you!
I don't know.
Thank you.
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
I'll take care of that.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Just a scene I cut out.
I want to talk to you for a minute.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
Tails.  That's ridiculous.
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
You think this is all very funny.
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
Keep it.
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
Don't you want to come along, darling?
He must be quite a guy.
Why do you say that?
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
Is that So?
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
But which one?
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
I don't feel like it right now.
What do you want?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
Let's talk about us, not her.
All this talk about love, it's silly.
Let me kiss you.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
Away. From you.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
Miss what?
I don't see why not.
But what if---it wasn't real?
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
A little.
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
Do you have any theories about last night?
How do you know?
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
Where is Earth?
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
Your hair looks the same.
What can I do for you?
I have to talk to you.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
What's it like?
But it's impossible.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
Tuesday.
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
There's no vodka in it.
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
It sure is.
You know what's the problem?
Who?
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
There's a lot of choices here.
No, thanks.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
He really was!
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Kitchen. . . Technician
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
The boss wants to see you.
Man, what is this?
When?
First question got to be "Where."
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
Who's the other woman?
What about me?
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
She's not his mama either.
A normal person.
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
He's the only one who can operate this --
Jimmy, how's the -
Anybody been hurt?
So far the hostages are unharmed.
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
I don't?
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Lois, you're amazing.
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
It's true. It's true.
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
Genius!  --  Lex.
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
But he's never there.
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
Hey! Just remember I made you.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
What I need this for?
Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
But . . . how could you beat him?
Bunkers!
You're a great architect, Albert.
Thank you.
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
Unbelievable.
Huh?
There weren't any wires. I looked.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
You're just jealous.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
So I've noticed.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
See?
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
Meteorites!
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
-- as we will be.
Lara, please...
You've got me? Who's got you???
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
How much do you weigh?
Uh-huh.
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
They'll soon be over.
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
Yes...fine.
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
A while.
And what's that?
No.  A little sugar though.
How was it?
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.
What's a ditty again?
I don't want you to lie.
Dolores.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
Will you be spending more than a night?
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
Yes.
Need a hand?
Tell me about it.
Almost three.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
Yes.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
You are?
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
Of course.
Pretty slick, eh?
It's okay.
Nothing.
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
What's going to happen to Dolores?
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
Come on boys, break it up...
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
You told him that?
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what.  Right, Otis?
Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...
Is it news to you?
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
But not for anything I did today...
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
I don't think so.
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
This sort of thing!
Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
Go home, Sally.  It's late...
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
Yes, but why?
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
Like you?
I tried to reach you twice -
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
I can't
Please... let... the kids... go...
We should abort.
Do you have bandages?
No one must follow your work.
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
You have to do what I say?!
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
Not even of dying?
Torque wrench please.
Why do you cry?
She intends to change the future somehow.
I'll deal with the police.
No shit?
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
I love you, John.  I always have.
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
Why attack Russia?
Yesterday I read that Furtwängler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
You have a question for Helmuth, David?
Yes, David?
With more what? More what?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwängler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
Your mother, too.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
Then you are wrong.
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
Tell me about von der Null.
Von der Null?
And what happened to Von der Nul?
I'm sorry.
Of course I know what that is.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
Do you know what's in this archive?
Major.
Helmuth.
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
Was a member of...?  Speak up?
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwängler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
The Miracle Kid.
Yes, Dr. Furtwängler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Dr. Furtwängler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
I hate the beige one.
Do you understand?
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
I don't understand...
You cold?
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
That's not my mission.
Kyle?
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
What are you doing?
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?
I can help you...
Send a unit.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
Go!  Go!  He's got her.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
Did you play recently?
Clean out your locker.
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
It was a gift... from my brother.
Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
Never did catch your name.
The maitre d' called you Christine.
Seriously?  What did they say?
You?
Take the picture out.
Then, what good are you?
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
That's not true...
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
No.
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
So do you.  And to think I was worried...
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
Like a stroke?
It doesn't matter...
I'm going to call.
How do you mean, exactly?
What have they been doing to you?
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Stop this.  It's not true...
Yeah.
Yes.
I need your car, Elizabeth.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
Drive in.
I've been so lonely.
Fine.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
What makes you ask?
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
What's the trouble?
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
Attractive...
Don't ask.
He hasn't called back.
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
What?
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
Well, this lot is full!
And that will be a good place to end this study.
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
It was very specific.
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
It was a stupid thing to do.
Someone is playing with you.
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
What'll happen to us, Nell?
This is where we're going?
Maybe they're Mary's.
Is she asleep?
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
I don't know what to think anymore.
I don't think I want any.
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
What'd you come back for, babe?
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
Then what good is he?
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
It's not a knock.
As soon as you get dressed.
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
Why not?
This is un-fucking professional.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
Let him break - he likes to break.
Oh really?  Where you from?
No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
This ain't your lot?
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
And that's where you met Jenny.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
No one else is even here yet.
Too easy?
He's gotta know why.
Didn't get it.
Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
Had a feeling it was you.
Sort a few things out.
What was that, then?
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed.
When did you get in?
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
I bet.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
Are you serious.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
What about your grandmother?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
Sounds like you need a rest.
Hey.
Which kind?
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
Walked.
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
Exercising my visitation rights.
You've made it ... brighter.
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
Yes. Thank you.
Hello, Birdy.
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
...You are ze fahzer?
A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?
That right.
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
Maybe.
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
...That's quite a wife you got there.
All right, I guess.
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
...Ed, I...
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
I don't know what's going on. I--
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
Honey...
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
Coffee, Ed?
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
Yeah.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
Uh-huh.
Whuddya mean?
What the--
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
Birdy... I didn't mean to--
'Lo, Ed.
Mr...?
Crane. Ed Crane.
Hello!
Could you come with me please?
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
What's the combination?
Battery's dead.  Shit.
What doors?
Ippolito!  Get back here!
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
You're kidding.
I smell it.  It's here.
This place is a maze.
What happened?!
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
I'm coming with you.
What's that?
Yes, I do.
Not that big.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
Margo, you haven't heard?
What?
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
Is Dr. Frock safe!
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
Where did you see it?
Genetic damage?
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
What is it doing?
How?
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
Thank you.
--a dead one at that.
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
Nothing was real.
Sure she would.
No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?
I think I'm mixed up in something.
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
I won't be late.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
Let's go now.
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
--What the hell are you talking about?!
Who were you talking to?!
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.
It looks so small.
They're going to stop me talking to you.
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
-- You saw this experiment?
I'm on the roof.
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
What? What are you talking about?
I wake you?
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
What did you find?
And you've never seen anything like that?
And where are they going with it?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
Been where?
Where'd they go?
Scully --
We've got to keep moving.
I don't know anything about that.
You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
Agent Mulder --
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
About the conspiracy?
What is it?
Why are you telling me this?
What alien environment?
Our vaccine may have no effect!
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
No.
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
I don't need them anymore...
You don't know the procedure.
Peter, okay?
What did you see?
You're the shrink, you tell me.
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
COME ON!
He's mine?
What now?
Catherine!
Nervous?
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
You're looking well.
That's a secret.
Awaiting his arrival.
You sure you want to go through with this?
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
Do you understand German?
I don't know. They didn't answer.
Oh, that was many years ago.
I'm so sorry.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
What's the matter?
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
How do you know?
He works in a military hospital.
I can't say that I have.
Ever seen one?
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
Next, Paine.
Bring him in.
...in the morning.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
How about the doorway?
...of Santa Fe."
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
...his number.
You do!
They wouldn't know me.
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
Goodness, that's awkward.
Seems exciting.
She's been arrested.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
The Roumanian?
Vinkel.
Martins.
Excuse me!
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
I was told that he did not die at once.
Yes.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
Should I make it all fact?
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Lime.  Harry Lime.
Okay.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
Everyone ok?
Hi.
I think so too.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
Watch your language....
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
They don't have extermination camps.
Yes.
What do you care?
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.  There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
People still need values, beliefs....
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
Oh, really?
Who's Linda?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
That's stupid.
Fuck that.
Why should I submit?
No, I think you shouldn't.
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
You gotta get out of here.
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
A poison...?
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
You do it on the inside....
Don't tell me what I --
It's German.
What part of Germany are you people from?
Hello...?
Who told you that?
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
No.
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
No!
Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
You're right.  You're fired.
He seems to have won it.
I tell you she's mine!
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
... It's a comfortable place.
Is he alright?  What happened?
Then tell him to wax it too.
What about the shoes?
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
And where did you say you were from?
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?
Great!
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
... Everything.
You don't have that one, do you?
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
Anybody can have a bad day!
Don't you have a heater?
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
I don't know... why?
I'd better get back now.
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
Promise me one thing.
... Are you sure?
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Why don't you ask me?
Uncle Louis!
It's my apartment.
... And the new stereo.
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
I'll have to talk to the driver.
Will he understand Spanish?
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
What's your first move?
What's up?
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
Client notes. Sorry.  What can I do for you?
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
Get off of me you cripple!
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
They don't say it to me.
Sure.
I want him to lock me up.
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click — click — click.
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
It's about the leopard.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
Come to look around?
Some crazy guy.
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
I couldn't rest —- I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter —whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
That was unfortunate.
Go on foot.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so ——
You're too good to me.
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
Will you please come with me?
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress’s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
Mr Lombard...
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
You’re mad...
Huh! Don’t you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
You don’t say.
I didn’t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? I’ve known for five years. He’s known I’ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn’t speak about...
One just doesn’t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
Something like that?
Here we go again.
Don’t you believe in simplicity?
My husband didn’t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
What are you doing? You can’t. I...
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
May I ask where you’re from, Mr Lamont?
Okay. The woman just can’t walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why can’t you go to your Embassy?
I know where to look.
There’ve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, it’s just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
Get a pen and don’t ask any questions.
Friedman’s dead... They killed him...
Italian? The Mafia...?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
Emily...
Have we done business before?
May I have your phone number?
Where?
And who does Friedman work for?
How many of you scumbags are here?
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He’s got a safe...  I need a doctor...
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Have you heard of a French film called “La Collectionoose”?
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
I presume you checked your son’s apartment...
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
Problems?
Clients come and go.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. You’ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he’s using?
Three o’clock.
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
I’m sorry...
That’s what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldn’t take on another child, that he’d get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasn’t listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think he’s back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some people’s minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leon’s. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
Er... Yes...
Barstow’s 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you’re heading, I reckon somebody’ll pick you up.
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Cinq cents.
Où est passé ton salon?
Alors quoi?
What do you think, huh?
What you gonna do? Kill me?
Moreau? C’est moi. Alors...
They lost their son. Why?
I also need someone who can read and write.
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
What's going on?!
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
We must sound the retreat!
Jeanne's alive!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
And when was that?
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Where... where am I?
Really?
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
In a village called Domremy.
Not long ago...
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!  In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want??
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
Thanks be to God.
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
Supposing she's an assassin?
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?
Yes... they were.
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
The wind will be against us...
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
Yes.  We can pray.
Clear?
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
Do you know how to count?
But my voices... they promised me...
I... submit to Our Lord.
Yeah...
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
Why were you yelling like that?!
What do you mean, they won't come?
Do you think this cross will protect you?
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
Him?
He never says his name.
Only God knows the answer to that.
I want to be with him always...
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
Sit.
What did I tell you?
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
What's happened?
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
They were taking you away.
Very appropriate.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
Yes, but what good did it do?
You're amazing, Jehuda.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
How long have you been here?
You made contact?
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
What's happening?
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
There is something to be said for silence
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
What's he say?
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.
You don't want to learn.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
You have to wash them.
She says, throw the piano overboard.
The wallet.  You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
You think my play is bad?
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
We cleared 22 here.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
I'm busy, Floyd.
Which one?
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Yes sir.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
How'd ya do?
What do ya mean?
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know.
Yeh.
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
See ya and raise three.
See and raise 1,000.
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
The name is Lonnegan.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
What time you get off work here?
No.
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
Then why the rat?
What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
And you were gonna pay me back?
I didn't get the bet down in time.
You want a drink or something?
No.
You got nothin' on me.
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
Another young man.
That is, if it's all right with you.
Oh, Andy.
You've got to get your mind off this.
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
You're high enough.
How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Mother!
He didn't do it -- Nick!
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
Where did you hit her?
Where did you get this gun?
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
How'd you people happen to pop in?
What's he want of you?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
What about this Nunheim?
He's holding out on you.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Rosebreen.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
I didn't know they had a fight.
I see.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.
Just what I said I'd do.
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
It might.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Where's Gilbert?
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
So it's you he was after!
Hello, baby.
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
Who is she?
How many drinks have you had?
Six Martinis.
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
Who's that?
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
No.
Maybe a drink would help you.
You're a fine watch dog.
Aren't you hot in that?
Yes.
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
You talk as if I were Asta.
Maybe I will.
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
Sure I will.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
Yes!
Got a nice evening dress?
The suspects!  They won't come.
I wish you'd tell me who.
Yes.  Nick!
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Turn the car around.
Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
What are we going to do!?
They stopped.
Ready?
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
Where'd they go?
Maybe we should split it up now.
You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
Get off him.
I've got no stomach for murder.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
You think?
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
Take the binoculars.
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
I don't hear any--
It's a fire fight.
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
X marks the spot.
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
Jesus, Jaeger.
What the hell took so long.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
We can't just leave him.
What if he's not?
Sure.
What do you figure it is?
To where?
With what?  Against how many?
I didn't say that.  I never said--
The...the gold...
Threatened to blow my brains out?
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
Woods.
They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
People are suffering.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
What does that mean?
He says it's a box.
Like I said; so?
What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
I thought we were dead.
Yeah, well, we're not.
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
You have to go with us, Wes.
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
It's got a bottom.
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
Drug evasion with....
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
A sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?
What happened?
4732...?
Then why did you bring it up?
No!  Don't go.
Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away?  Economically, it's not sound at all.  Very much unlike....
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
You're in violation.
I'll report you.  It's....
What are you doing here?
...and you're not lost now?
What was that....
She's not there
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
Go ahead.
What're you talking about?
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
Hey, look--
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
This is where the van was parked.
You guys seem pretty tight.
What?
It's working.
Should we head for the Interstate?
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
You got it.
What do ay say?
Alright!
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
I want to work this.
What the hell was that?
Prints?
He is!
Look who's talking, old man.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
P.E.T.N ...
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
I'll do it.
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
I know.
Yes.
What did you talk about?
No.
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
Nice suit.
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
No, not at all!
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
Monescu.
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
No, thank you.
Last year? It can't be that long.
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
I remember.
Oh!
What shade of powder do you use?
Do you realize I have light eyes?
And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?
Eighteenth century.
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
I'll be delighted.
Crimson!
No--yours, madame.
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I <u>believe</u> you.
Then why do you want to go?
I know!
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Then why did you do it?
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
How much time?
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
None of the stewards have seen her.
What could possible be funny?
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.  Mind your step.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
Sure. Count me in.
Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!
You know somebody?
The boats are all going.
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
You're distracting me. Go away.
You're crazy.
Hello again.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
Yes, exactly!
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
Sure. If you like.
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
I don't know the steps.
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
You're trembling.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
Yes sir.
You think she was really there?
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.
Would you like anything?
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
Good afternoon--
You'll excuse me. 
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Guess again, copper.
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
I'm so sorry!
I'll say she is!
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
Never eat before the show.
This is Mr.--er--
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
Don't be a c-a-t.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Shortie!--you know my motto?
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
About sixteen hundred.
<U>Me</U>!
Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
In New York.
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
June? That's my wife's name.
O.K.! Send that!
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
What?
I was never stiffer in my life.
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
I didn't--
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
Is that one of the Who's Who?
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
I wish I could.
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
Yes, Yes!
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
Sure, Sis.
Nothin'.
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
He said to turn loose of him.
Beauty, ain't he?
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
Yeah, you look it.
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
That's great coming from you.
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
I don't believe it.  He's clean!
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
You're a little touchy about it.
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.
What can I get you?
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
Come up to the fire, honey.
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
Well how do we look?
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
Why don't you just leave it alone?
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.
- Instant melt-down.
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
Political considerations?
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
Bourbon. Neat.
Have we met?
- Shut up!
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.  And thanks to your little show and tell -  - giving him the evidence -  We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
Blood or Dutch?
Wait here.
Are you listening to me?
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
And when might that be?
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
No -
Is the helicopter ready?
Will it go off?
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
It is just a regular card.
Hush.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
You must have been really sick.
What, are you having another party?
Why didn't you catch a plane?
Man, act like this is your home.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
Let me get you a cup?
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
Those boys never did have good luck.
That's nice.
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
Hey!  Wow!
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
Yes, I can.
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
THAT is Sid!
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Don't tell me what to do!
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Are you peeking?
Oh, that is disgusting.
I don't know!
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
You murdering dog!
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
I got it, Woody!
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
This is ludicrous.
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
You'll put your clothes here.
I did like the music.
Is there anything else I should know about him?
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
You're only a young thing.
You're not so old yourself!
Well ... yes. All right. But -
H'm?
It was only a mouthful!
I already lost everything once.
I don't know what you mean.
Why does he need money?
I want to believe you.  I really do.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
Did you get it?
Don't bother.
So my wife is lying?
I think she's lying.
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
Me, too.
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
Hi.
What if every country legalized at the same time?
Will we get invited to the White House?
Okay, young lady, that's it.
Live with your parents?
I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
What do you think she wants?
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
One chance here, Eduardo.  Make us believe you got a boss.  No boss, it's all on you.
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
Yes, sir!
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with.
Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you don't care bullshit.  This is incredible information.  It must be. Javi --
A place we have, that we know is protected.
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
We agree.
An informant.
Only if he can be trusted.
I'm curious how you did this with such economy.
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
It's possible.
Noriega is a criminal.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
Who do we interface with on their side?
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
Well, I've not brought them.
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
For fuck's sake.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
Can you not go yourself.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Thanks.
Easy for you to say.
Can I see you again?
Yes.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
What? Steady like?
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
Tommy, let's put the tape on.
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
Following the game at all?
No.
Running time?
What about The Untouchables?
Did he -- you know?
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
Your usual table, sir?
And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
It's the great outdoors.
We go for a walk.
What?
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
Then I shall make use of this starship.
The ship....
Plotting our new course.
Bob?
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
Yes, Captain.
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
Is it possible?
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
No! No reply. Remain on course.
About the ship...
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
I don't get it.
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
Okay, okay...
To warn him.
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
I'm your program?
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
Meanwhile, he might find it.
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
Where did you hear that name?
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
Greetings, program...
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
Hey... you guys OK?
Flynn, we've got to help him!
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
A User?
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
Now what?
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
But you didn't.  Why not?
So, it was your first time.
Well, what's the point of waiting?
It's certainly... dramatic.
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
That's fabulous Harry.
What did you tell him?
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
What did you need?
It makes you tell the truth?
17 years.
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
What about Juno?
Did you pork her Harry?
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
You working on someone right now?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
Yeeaoowww!!
What's going on, Harry?
Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.
Worse than Cairo?							*
What is it you want me to do?
You'll call me then?
How?
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
Has he looked through it yet?
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
I took a cab.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
No. Not particularly.  How come?
What's your favorite movie star?
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
That's a long time.
She OD'd, didn't she?
"Heroes For Sale"?
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
What?
Is this a joke?
I think what you did was...
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Yeah.
Get the fuck outta here!
You goin' out?
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
Is he big league?
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
Yeah?
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
Look, Dick, I don't -
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
What?
Elliot.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
I can, but I don't.
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
Nope.
Who is he?
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
Sorta room-mates?
Yes.
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
What kind of information?
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
No.
Hiding?
You're afraid of germs?
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
Are you hurt?
James, why don't we...?
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
The gun! ... I lost it
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
What....???
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
He's been tested for drugs?
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
Hey!  You there!
You want something, old man?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Nothing.
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
But, in particular?
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
Two-hundred.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
What you want?
For the love of God would you two give it a rest?  Lord almighty.  In all my years I have never seen anything so pathetic.  How far did you think you were going to get with this?  Neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat.  Now use what little smarts you got.  If I was going to bust you I wouldn't have waited until after you killed Jake.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
How could I?  I was sleeping.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
I'm just going to my car.
You sure you can manage?
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
Thank you, John.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
A medicine man?
My face tell you all that?
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
Did you ever?
I'm guessing no.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
You just walk away.
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
Where are you going?
To get my car.
He was going to--
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
But I want to say with you,
Where the hell am I going to go?
The trunk.  It's locked.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
I'm her husband.
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Accident.
Where you headed?
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Hey!
I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
How do you put a price on murder?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
You love her, but you hate her?
Shut up.
Came close this time and it scares you.
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
That's a thick change of heart.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
That's a shame, John.  A real shame.
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Jesus!
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
But, Senor--
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
You afraid of the dark?
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
I wasn't doing anything.
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Christ, I don't believe this!
Mister!
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Accident.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Live there?
I need thirteen.
It's not what you think, Jake.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Twenty-after-ten.
Nothing.
How much!?
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
Where you headed?
Did you like it; me watching you?
Nice place.
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
I don't know about that?
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
My mother died in this canyon.
Bobby? Are you all right?
Where ya goin'?
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
Is Noel in?
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
Yes.
When was the last time I wore pink?
Megan?
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
...I think rust.
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty--
What things?
No.
How many did you put on that time?
All of it.
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
Not really.
Did you get up from your seat?
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
Is this a religious thing?
She's gonna live.  She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
Where'd you get the money, huh?
Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
He give 'em names?
Three days. Are you hungry?
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Hit your finger, huh?
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
Yeah, I guess so.
Maybe I ain't.
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
Tell me right off if you see him.
Did... you... get... him?
Yeah?
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
Eleven.
Two weeks, I guess.
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
You ain't like that no more.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
He's dead, Bill.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
Who's he?
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
Jesus.  You done this before?
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
Well, suppose he does?
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
Keyser Soze
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
You watch your mouth.
How are they going to do it?
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Ready?
You set up the line-up.
Mr. Soze will be most -
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
He won't go into the interrogation room.
I'11 find him.
No, no, no, no, no.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
You're joking.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
Orthopedics?
I know of him.
...of Anesthesiology?
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
Just now...
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
I.  Yes.  It is.
I read the hospital report on your client.
You know what happened.
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Then why don't you testify?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
That happens.
Exception!
Continental Casualty...
Mr. Alito, please.
I can't guarantee that...
Kathy Price.
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
D'you find an apartment?
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Yes.  It was, actually.
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
Joe...  Joe...
Dr. Gruber.
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
...I'm going to need your help...
No.
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
The broad has disappeared...
What are you doing in New York...?
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
Yes.  Yes, I have.
She told me.
What?
How old is he?
Who told you that?
Yes.
What did she say?
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
The Big Boy did...?
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
How can I see her, to know her?
Why did she never tell her daughter?
Did she hurt herself?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Just let me talk to you.
I told you! Right here!
But before! Where did you live before!?!
I'll take care of you.
No? Then what?
I just want to see you as much as I can!
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
Why?!
Scottie, what are you doing?
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
We're going awfully far.
Scottie, why are we here?
Take me away...
Scottie, please...!
Yes!
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
What?
Well... anywhere in particular?
Do you know where you're going?
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
The tall trees...
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
No!
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
How do you know?
You can't.
Is there something I can do for you?
Please answer my question.
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
How's your love life, Midge?
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
That!?!
Step number two.
Here you are.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
Can we have it by tonight?
I didn't hear you.
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
The floor was wet. She slipped!
I have plenty of friends.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
I'm calling the ambulance.
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
That is absolutely not true.
I am not flexible on this.
You got us into this mess.
Fuck you Boyd!
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
It has worked.
They're driving me nuts!
We'll be ready Adam.
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
I got you.
My god.
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
He's cracked up.
I said, what have we done?
What does that mean?
Isn't it a little late?
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
Ball park sausages.
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Easy Micheal.
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
Sent it.
Why?
What else have you forgot?
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
Stop it. I'm sorry.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
He's a moron.
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
We've got problems here.
Take care of those chairs.
I will.
What are you doing?
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
Just kills me...
The wahoo?
I have no idea.
You alright?
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
No, the children sleep with me.
What's that?
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
How much is that?
If you wake first, wake me up.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
I know that you used to work with an architect.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
Are your parents alive?
A black bull came.
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
Yes!
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
Forgive me if I have offended you.
I have a headache.
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar —— you making it okay in there?
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
I should have told him.
Only because I got pulled out early.
Think you can do it?
If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
I'M WHAT?!
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
Talk so I can understand.
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
I am beautiful, aren't I?
How can I ever thank—you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
What happened when he was 17?
What are you doing?
I've been in prison, remember?
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Don't get out of the car.
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
You don't know?
Then shoot him already.
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
Do they have to look so...robotic?
You want some research, flu?  Side-effects of medi....
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
Don't you want to know if it's true?
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
What crisis?
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
Tell me again.
...but...
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
...<u>nothing</u>...
Yes.  That's true.  But...
...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
We're gonna do the <u>Team Song</u>.
He just got Hip to us.  He just ended the War.
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
ON SCHUMANN, WHO HAS CONE TO THE BACK OF THE COUNTER, AND IS EMPTYING THE CANNISTERS.
...member of the group, was left behind what were, then, Enemy Lines. 
I gotta get something, I gotta get ...shoes?  Ties? Hats...?  Good.  Good. 
S'only got to hold for another few days.
Ask it.
Why do people go to war?
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
Because.
What do we have that they want?
...who is this guy...?
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
Against...who could be aggressor....Help me out here...Units of 303, the Defense Department confirms, early this morning, Albanian Time, stormed a mountain hideaway, near the city of -- help me out here -- and freed a tired, but happy William Schumann, Suffering no casualties.  His condition is reported as Guarded, and his route to the US has not been disclosed, but a high White House source confirms he is expected in Washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service.  Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural.  Nine A.M...?  Nine?  Miss the commuters, but...
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
He's fine, as long as he gets his medication.
No, I didn't think so.
Y'know what else bothers me?  "Shh lil baby, don' saya word, papa's gon buy you a mocking bird..."  The baby don'say a word, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MOTHERFUCKING MOCKING BIRD GONE SAY?  You follow me...?
Get on your feet, boy.
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
Well, <u>that</u> ain't very butch, is it?
...the Suitcase Bomb.  ACT ONE Albania denies it. President comes on the air, "Be Calm."  Okay, now: Good.  Now, Alright.  Act <u>TWO</u>...  I need the following here.  Right now:  Johnnie Green, Liz Butsky, and get me the Fad King.
Better.
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
Why a beret?
Yes. 
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
What's going on?
... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me.
Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
...thanks Natalie.
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
What was that?
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
So what firm you with, pal?
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
How much is enough Gordon?
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
Excuse me.
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
You could have a great beach house for that.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Where is it?
Upper West Side.
What if I have a previous engagement?
You really do believe in destiny?
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
He did?
Weird and tiny huh?
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?
No?
Can I give her a message?
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Are you humoring me?
How?
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
Do you?
Have you been hurt?
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
Who?
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
Who?  Your husband?
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
Thank you.
I don't know.
What was her major?
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
He was so pissed.
Do we have to?
How you holding up?
Okay, I'm a little tender.
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
Thanks, but I'm fine.
You think he killed her?
Telling you...
The planchette?
It's alright.
Then what was it?
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
I can't believe this is happening.
I guess not.
You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
I think three...
If you have to work...
Not the focus.
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
Did you...
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
Claire?
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
You didn't?
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
Tonight?
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
What?
You know I am.
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
The...
...Please stop...
Ow!
What's the matter?
I was there.
Claire, please don't...
Who?
We have to get out of here.
What?
How can you be sure?
Do you know it?
Mmmuh...
What?
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
What have the witches always asked of you...?
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
Then you wear it.
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
Stop it!
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
Lasher - bring us through!
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
I do not understand...
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Doctor's orders- - -?
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
She - she said I - I was a ---
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
On which planet...?
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
Rowan Mayfair.
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
OH MY GAWD!
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
All the time?
Do you take sugar?
Oh, about six years since I graduated
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
What did you do with her?
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
What's wrong?
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
What happened?
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
I thought it was you - how are you?
That's good
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
Yes...?
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Cut it out, before you break something!
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
So far away? In Xenia?
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
You go first.
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
But that smile.
Yeah? You like?
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
You have changed since second grade.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
The lesson being?
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
Whatever helps you cope.
It's okay. You need me?
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Teddy? I was thinking.
Ted! Do something!
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
I understand.
My new bike.
If you could just sign right there.
You're a peach.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I'm trying to help.
What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
Funny you should say "peachy."
It's incredibly simple.
Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.
He's on the move?
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
That's refreshingly deviant.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
I want you to trust me.
Very ambitious. I like that.
Yellow pages?
That's part of growing up, honey.
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
But who would run the store?
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
I can't wait to see the pictures.
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
In a hurry, are we?
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
And where might that be?
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
Ray, you heard him...
Yeah, maybe, a little.
He did say something.
Yeah... okay... he did
What did you do then?
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
This wasn't my idea.
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
What?
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
Is there some reason why you're here?
Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
Duquette.  Forget him...
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
I just want my life back...
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
Get away from me.
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
You need that real often?
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
What was all that back there?
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
Jim, are you all right?
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Oh, thank you.
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
She's perfectly safe.
Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
That would be... the Mexican War?
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
They're coming.
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
They look like acorns.
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
Because it's true.
Then you get us out of here.
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
I'll help you...!
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
I don't know, Willow.
No.
I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this?
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
Oooh, this smells terrible.
His will.
I just wanted to test it first.
I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
Why?
Time is running out.
Get back here, Rool!
She needs to be changed.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Who??
Hey, careful there!
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
Where's Timmy and Buck?
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
Is it them?
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
No.
No, no doctor...
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Sure.
But... You may not be well enough.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
I got there late, John.
It's me.
Yes.
God, Fred...
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
You are acting like one!
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
Momma... are they angry with us.
I wish dawdie was with us.
No --
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
...didn't you?
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
Toto, too.
How did you guess?
Yes --
Aw, come, come, come --
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Now you're seeing reason.
Where do you want to be oiled first?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
I'd sooner wait outside.
But why?  Why?
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
I have so got brains.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Ohhhh --
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
The other side....
...along.
I've got a plan how to get in there.
That's right.
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
You mean she bit you?
...junk!
Beautiful!  What an echo!
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
It's a whozis.
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Nuclear.
Is there another way?
I took the initiative.
Consider me ungrateful.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
I’m sorry.
Funerals aren’t exactly memorable.
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
No!  It will cave in!
James...
I have to go.
Vodka martini.
What are you talking about?
You can drop the act, it’s over.
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn’t have to sleep with you to find that out.
I could have given you the world.
Since I was a child, I’ve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn’t rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
So you killed your father.
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. I’m going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather’s name, the glory of my people.
See?  You’re upsetting my customers. What do you want?
Where did you get this?
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn’t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
Where’s the sub going?!
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn’t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  It’s what you wanted.
What about our end?
God isn't there to do it.
Jon, where are we?
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
And what if you¹re wrong?
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
. . . What?
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
That's because --
What was he doing?
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
I can fix it.
I don't know their real names.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
"Anarchy" 99"?
Like what?
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
You do everything Yorgi says?
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
We'll have to go after them.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
You're serious?
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
This pizda? Never seen him before.
What's going on, my friend?
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
What's that?
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
Let go.
I've seen a lot of rings.
What do you want?
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
Yes, my dear, he is.
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
Baack!
Still happy you married me?
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Darling!
Well... yes.
You have your tickets?
Very....very!
Oh, nice.
Darling!
Surprised!
Darling!?!
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
It seems fine.
Yes!... the laboratory.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
I see.
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
What?
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
What is this place?
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
Do you have the name I wrote down?
Tonight?
More, do you hear me?
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
... I'm glad that's...
How do you know it was a 'she'?
I'm a failure.
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
Hello there.
How's everything?
Get the sedative ready!
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
May I see your violin?
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Are you busy?
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
Look, Doctor!
And look at this, Doctor!
I think you've done it, master.
What are you going to do?
Me?  Sing?
All right -- give it to him!
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
His schwanzstucker.
An historical moment, Gentlemen.
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
